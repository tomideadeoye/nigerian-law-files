## **CHAPTER TWO**

**VARIOUS PROPERTY LAW TRANSACIONS AND DEED**

Most times in the exam, students are asked to identify the various property transactions from a given scenario, as well as the status of parties, the documents/instruments to be executed and the party responsible for the preparation of such documents; (**see Bar Final August 2017 Q 3a and 5a &b, April 2018 Q 1a & 4b, August 2018 Q 1vii, 3(1a&b), August 2019 Q 2ii and January 2020 Q 6a&b)**

**The Various Property Law Transactions are:**

1. **SALE OF LAND**: This is where the scenario suggests that the parties either wants to buy, purchase, sell or transfer unexpired residue in a land. It is outright transfer of the interest of the owner to the purchaser. Sale of land gives rise to two documents which are:
   a. **Contract of Sale** of **land** or **Sale of Land Agreement**: The parties to the transaction are **Vendor**/**Purchaser**. The **Vendor’s Solicitor** is to prepare the Contract of Sale of Land Agreement. It does not require governor’s consent since no legal interest is transferred yet.
   b. **Deed of Assignment:** This is the final instrument to be executed by the parties. The parties are **Assignor**/**Assignee**. The **Assignee’s Solicitor** is to prepare the Deed of Assignment and Governor’s consent is required for its perfection.
2. **LEASE AND SUB-LEASE**: This involves the grant of a term of years certain with an understanding that the owner retains a reversion over the property. The nomenclature of the parties and the document/instrument to be executed depends on the term of years granted.
   a. **Tenancy Agreement**: This is prepared where the term of years is 3 years or below. The parties are the Landlord/Tenant. The **Landlord’s Solicitor** is to prepare the Tenancy Agreement.
   b. **Deed of Lease**: this is prepared where the term of years is above 3 years. **NOTE** that if the property over which the lease was created is covered with a Certificate of Occupancy, it will be called a **SUBLEASE**. The parties are Lessor/lessee or Sub-Lessor/Sub- Lessee. The **Lessor’s Solicitor** is to prepare the Deed of Lease /Sub-Lease
3. **DONATION OF POWER:** This is where the owner of the property wants to authorize another to act on his/her behalf. It is by **Deed of Power of Attorney** since the donee is always expected to execute a deed. The parties are the Donor/Donee. The **Donor’s Solicitor** is to prepare the Power of Attorney.
4. **WIL**L: It is a wilful disposition of a person’s estate during his life time to take effect upon his death. The parties are the Testator (the maker of the Will), Executors (persons appointed to carry out the instructions in the Will) and Beneficiaries. The **Testator’s Solicitor** is to prepare the Will.
5. **MORTGAGE**: This is security transaction usually aimed at securing a loan given to the owner of the property. The document to be prepared if it is a legal mortgage is a **Deed of mortgage**. The parties are the **Mortgagor** (owner of the property and the borrower) and **Mortgagee** (usually the bank giving the loan). The **Mortgagee’s/Bank’s Solicitor** is to prepare the **Deed of Mortgage.**
6. **GIFT OF LAND**: This is the voluntary transfer or conveyance of any interest in land made gratuitously to a recipient and without any consideration paid by the recipient. There are certain conditions which must exist to make a gift of land valid:

   a. It must be by Deed i.e. **Deed of Gift (Dec 2020 Q 6a)**
   b. There must be intention of the donor to make the gift.
   c. There must be completed act of delivery to the recipient; and
   d. The beneficiary must have accepted the gift–**_Achodo v. Akagha_**

**NOTE:** there are other property transactions not mentioned under this topic because they are essential for your exams. It includes; pledge of land, lien, charge etc.

## **CHAPTER THREE**

**DOCUMENTS OF TRANSFER**

**DEEDS AND DEED OF ASSIGNMENT**

Most documents/instruments relating to transfer of interest in land or property law transactions must be made by **DEED**.

**DEEDS**

A deed is simply defined as a document in writing which is signed, sealed and delivered by the parties to be bound. It may be a deed poll (executed by one party e.g. Power of Attorney) or deed indenture (executed by two or more parties).

**Features or the Essential Elements of a Deed**

The elements are:

1. It must be in writing: **S.4, Statute of Fraud 1677**
2. Signing: **s.97(1) PCL** It must be signed by the parties because an unsigned deed is inadmissible against the party who has not signed it: **_Faro Bottling CO. Ltd v Osuji_**
3. Sealing
4. Delivery.
5. Attestation
6. Franking

**NOTE** that a Deed is valid even if it has no date or that it has a false or impossible date. **See** **_Anuku v. Standard Bank LTD_.**

**FORMAL PARTS OF A DEED OF ASSIGNMENT**

- This is one the most important sub-topics for the purpose of your Bar exam. There is no bar final without questions asking students to draft one part of a deed or another.
- The most frequently asked part includes; the **introductory part** and the **concluding part**. It is therefore essential for a student to learn how to draft each part; (see **Jan 2020 Q 5a & 6e, Dec 2020 Q 2cii)**

1.  **INTRODUCTORY PART**: This part consists of the Commencement, Date, Parties and Recital.
    a. **Commencement**: Usually a deed commences as **THIS DEED OF LEASE or THIS DEED OF MORTGAGE or THIS DEED OF ASSIGNMENT** depending on the transaction.
    b. **Date: MADE THIS……….DAY OF……20……**

    **NOTE** that the deed is still valid without an exact date affixed. This is because the important date is the date of delivery. Another reason is that putting an exact date may attract sanction for the parties since they must register the deed within 30 days from the date stipulated. So the practice is to leave the date until much later; **_see Anuku v Standard Bank PLC_** where the deed remained undated until Governor’s consent was given.

    C. **PARTIES**: usually introduced with the word ‘**BETWEEN’** followed by the names, addresses, occupation must be stated. For Example:
    BETWEEN **Best Trade Limited**, a company registered under the Companies and Allied Matters Act 2020 with its registered address at No 5 Ikewa Close, Zuma (ASSIGNOR) of the one part AND **Bala Linus**, of No 10 Dowadu Road, Bwari, Abuja (ASSIGNEE) of the other part

    D. **RECITALS**: This is a statement of facts pointing to the background of the transaction. There are 2 types:
    i. **Narrative**: This gives the history, background and how the assignor came about the property in issue and;
    ii. **Introductory**: This explains the intended transaction

         Example:
         **RECITAL** or **THIS DEED RECITES AS FOLLOWS**:
         1. The Assignor is the holder of a certificate of occupancy No…… over plot….(state the address)
         2. The Assignor desires to assign the plot No….. to the assignee for a consideration of sixty million naira

    **Importance of Recital: (August 2017 Q 1b, April 2018 Q 4e)**

    a. The Court uses recitals when interpreting deeds to clear ambiguity in the operating part. Ex Parte Davies
    b. It estopps parties from alleging contrary state of affairs and is binding on parties. Olukoya v Ashiru
    c. **S. 162 Evidence Act 2011**: recitals contained in documents 20 years old or more at the date of the contract are presumed to be sufficient evidence of the truth of the facts stated in those recitals except they are proved otherwise.

2.  **OPERATIVE PART (note sometimes you may be asked to list the contents of the operative part without drafting, see Bar Final 2015, 2017, April & August 2018 and 2019):** it consists of the following clauses: Testatum, Consideration, Receipt Clause, Capacity, Words of grant, Parcel clause, Habendum.

    1. **Testatum**: It introduces the operative part of a deed. It commences with: **‘NOW THIS DEED WITNESSES AS FOLLOWS’**
    2. **Consideration Clause**: This is the amount for which the assignor is giving the property to the assignee (demised). The **importance** is that it shows that the transaction is not a gift; also it helps in calculating the amount to be paid as stamp duties; (**August 2017 Q 1b).**

       **Example: ‘In consideration of the sum of……………paid by the Assignee to the Assignor’**

    3. **Receipt Clause:** it discloses that the vendor has collected the money for the property. Once inserted, it prevents the necessity of issuing another receipt to the assignee. It is usually in bracket.

       **Example**: (**the receipt of which the Assignor hereby acknowledge**).

    4. **Capacity Clause**: It guarantees the title of the assignor to the property. Usually, the best capacity is for the Assignor to assign as a ‘**BENEFICIAL OWNER’**
    5. **Words of Grant**: it could be ‘**Hereby Assign’**, ‘**conveys’** or ‘**demise’**. However, once you start with assignor, you must use the word ‘assign’.
    6. **Parcel Clause**: This is proper description of the property. The property must be sufficiently described to satisfy the requirement under the law. Usually starts thus ‘**ALL THAT PARCEL** of land situates……..
    7. **Habendum**: This describes the estate that is going to the assignee for e.g. **‘TO HOLD UNTO** the purchaser all that unexpired residue of the term of years in the certificate of occupancy subject to Governor’s consent”.

3.  **MISCELLANEOUS PART**: This part contains extraneous details in the deed which may consist of the clauses for undertaking for safe custody and periodic production.

- **Undertaking for Safe Custody and Acknowledgment for Production** is to be inserted in the deed when a particular document relates to several properties among which the assignee has been assigned some part of the property.

This is because the document contains several properties, it cannot be given to the assignee but the deed will contain an undertaking that the assignee can see the document whenever he asks for it.

1. **CONCLUDING** **PART** the concluding part consists of the following clauses Testimonuim, Schedule, Execution clause, Attestation; **January 2020 Q 2b & 6e.** It is one of the mostly asked part in the exam together with the introductory part**.**

- **Testimonium**: **“**IN WITNESS OF WHICH THE PARTIES HAVE EXCUTED THIS DEED IN THE MANNER BELOW THE DAY AND YEAR AND FIRST ABOVE WRITTEN”

**NOTE: In the exam you may be asked to draft only the testimonium)**

- **Execution and Attestation**: This is the signature of the parties and their witnesses. For Example:
- **SIGNED, SEALED AND DELIVERED** by the Assignor/Lessor/Mortgagor

**…………………………**

**Mr Aims Sam**

IN THE PRESENCE OF:

Name…………………

Occupation…………..

Signature…………….

(Repeat the same sequence for the second party)

**If any of the parties is a company it will be drafted thus:**

………………………………..

Name of donor… {Through his Lawful Attorney (name of donee) duly appointed by a Power of Attorney dated…..day of….20….. and registered as 11/222/20}

**PERFECTION OF DEEDS**

All transactions that are by deed needs to be perfected in accordance with the relevant applicable laws**.**

This involves the following:

1. Obtaining the **Governor’s** **Consent**, see S. 22(2) of the Land Use Act
2. **Stamping** the Deed of assignment (within 30 day of creation of the document)
3. **Registration** (within 60 days of the creation of the document).

**CSR**\-Consent, Stamping and Registration. (It is usually asked in MCQ)

**The Effect of Failure To Perfect Title To Property**

This will be discussed based on the various aspect of perfecting title in the main topics.

- **Failure to Obtain the Governor’s Consent** as regards land in a State or the Minister’s consent when dealing with land in Abuja.

1. It makes the legal transfer of interest to be void: **_Savannah Bank v Ajilo_**; section 22 **Land Use Act**
2. Makes the interest equitable or inchoate, see **_Awojugbagbe Light Industries v. Chinukwe_.**

- **Failure To Stamp The Deed:**

1. It will not be admissible in evidence. **Note** Court has power to order party to go and stamp and then admit it in evidence; **_Onashile v Barclays Bank_**
2. Penalty will be paid as fine for late stamping
3. Registrar will not accept it for registration

- **Failure To Register The Deed**

1. It is not admissible in evidence as proof of title
2. The interested party will not have priority over the land
3. It will only vest equitable interest in the owner
4. Late registration also attracts penalty.

**CHAPTER FOUR**

**POWER OF ATTORNEY**

A power of attorney is an instrument (a document in writing) usually but not necessarily a deed, by which the principal called “donor” appoints an agent called “donee” and confers authority on him to perform certain specified acts or kinds of acts on his behalf– **_Ude v Nwara_**_;_ **_Chime v. Chime._**

**FEATURES OF POWER OF ATTORNEY (EXAM FOCUS)**

This is where most of the questions asked about Power of Attorney are centered). So take note of the following features of a POA

1. A Power of Attorney is an instrument of delegation. It is not an instrument of alienation and cannot be used to transfer interest in land; **_Ude v. Nwara_**_,_ **_Chime v. Chime._**
2. A Power of Attorney is usually in the form of a Deed Poll, (i.e., an instrument executed by only the Donor).

**NOTE:** that it is advisable for the donee to also sign the POA if he gave a consideration for it or if it was made in fulfillment of an obligation**.**

1. It specifies expressly the powers, which the donee, as an agent of the principal/donor can exercise.
2. A POA need not be by **DEED** except where the Donee in exercise of the power will be expected to execute a **DEED (**for example where the donee is authorized to sale land or create legal mortgage or lease above 3 years); **_Abina v. Farhat; Powell v London and Provincial Bank_**
3. As long as the donee acts within the scope of the power of attorney, he incurs no liability, and if there is a liability, it is the donor that bears it–**_Ude v. Nwara_**.
4. The Donor of a POA can still exercise the powers conferred on the donee without restriction. This will only result to **implied revocation** of the POA; **_Chime v. Chime_**_._
5. A POA given in respect of family property must be executed by the head of the family as one of the donors or as the sole donor; otherwise it is void; **_Ajamogun v. Oshunrinde_**
6. It is revocable except where it is expressed to be irrevocable; that is where it is coupled with consideration or where it is expressed to be irrevocable, usually for a limited period not exceeding 12 months.
7. The Donor and the Donee must both be legally capable (i.e. juristic persons) at the day of creation and throughout the period covered by the Power of Attorney. Therefore a POA given to a firm of lawyers without a named Legal practitioner or to an office without a named occupant is void/invalid; **_National Bank of Nigeria v. Korban Brothers_**
8. It attracts fixed stamp duty and does not need the consent of the Governor since it does not transfer interest in land; **_Ude v Nwara_**.
9. Finally, where the property to be executed or the Power of Attorney is to be executed outside Nigeria, it should be executed before a Notary Public to ease prove of due execution; **_Ezeigwe v Awudu_**

**Importance and Need For Power of Attorney (April 2019 No 4)**

Power of attorney may be required in certain circumstances which may include:

1. Where the donor for some reasons may not be able to carry out the act personally either due to unavailability as a result of being physically away from the property or being engaged in busy schedules; **_Ezeigwe v. Awudu; Chime v. Chime; Ude v. Nwara_**
2. Where expert skills of the donee is required such as where a donor donates to an Estate agent or Solicitor the responsibilities to put tenants in possession, collect rent, and evict tenants on a property.
3. Ill health or physical impairments may also make the appointment of an attorney imperative.
4. Where it is to secure interest of a purchaser pending the perfection of title of purchaser or performance of an obligation owed to the donee.
5. Where the estate is vast and cannot be effectively managed by the donor: **S. 46, 47 CA and S. 141 PCL; _Chime v Chime_**

**Distinction between Power of Attorney and Sale of Land**

1. Power of Attorney does not transfer interest in land while conveyance transfers interest in land.
2. Power of Attorney may not require Governor’s consent while a conveyance always requires the consent of the Governor: **S. 22, 23 & 26 Land Use Act**
3. Power of Attorney is usually executed by one party (deed poll) while in a conveyance, both parties execute it (indenture)
4. Deed is mandatory in a sale of land and not for Power of Attorney
5. Sale of land is only for land while POA can be for any transaction.

**REVOCATION OF POWER OF ATTORNEY**

A Power of Attorney may be revoked in any of three ways namely:

1. Express revocation;
2. Implied revocation
3. Revocation by operation of law; and
   - - 1. **Express Revocation–**Power of Attorney is governed by the rules of agency. Accordingly, in keeping with the rule that he who hires reserves the right to fire; the donor can expressly fire the donee or revoke the power. Note however, that where the appointment is by deed, the power must be revoked by deed–**_Adegbokun v. Akinsanya; Ojugbele v. Olasoji_** 2. **Implied Revocation–**This occurs where the donor after giving a Power of Attorney to a donee, still goes ahead to deal with the subject matter of the Power of Attorney in such a manner that makes it impossible for the donee to effect his authority under the Power; **_Chime v. Chime_.**

**The donor cannot challenge such exercise but may sue for damages for wrongful revocation or return of the consideration if any**.

- - - 1. **Revocation by Operation of Law–**Power of Attorney is deemed revoked by operation of law if the donor suffers death, insanity, liquidation, bankruptcy or other legal incapacity–**_Abina v. Farhat_ (supra); _UBA v. Registrar of Titles_.** An **EXCEPTION** is where the power is coupled with interest/consideration or it is fixed for a period of time, then the death, lunacy, or bankruptcy of the donor will not affect the power.

**NOTE** also that Power of Attorney can be invalidated if fraud, duress or undue influence is established (whether or not valuable consideration has been furnished)–**_Agbo v. Nwikolo._**

**IRREVOCABILITY OF POA**

A POA is irrevocable in 2 ways:

1. Where the POA is given for valuable consideration and expressed to be irrevocable: **s. 143 PCL; s 8(1) CA.** Such a POA cannot be revoked until the benefit for which it was conferred has been repaid: **_UBA v Registrar of Title_**
2. Where the POA was made irrevocable for a fixed period (not exceeding 12 months) whether given for valuable consideration or not: **s. 144 PCL; s. 9(1) CA.** Bankruptcy, death, lunacy or no consideration cannot lead to revocation of the POA within this time period

**CONSTRUCTION OF POA**

The powers conferred in a POA are strictly construed: **_NBA v Iteogu_**. Thus the donee can only exercise such powers that were expressly stated in the POA. This is to ensure that the donee does not exceed the power conferred on him.

The omnibus clause: **“and to do other things expedient, necessary, lawful as the donor would have done**” does not add additional powers to the donee than that specifically stated; **_Jacobs v Morris_**.

**Protection of Third Parties (April 2019 Q 4iv)**

A third party who had acted with the Donee based on a Power of Attorney which later was revoked is protected by Law on the following:

1. Where the third party is a **_bona fide_** purchaser for value without notice of the revocation of the owner, his interest will be protected.
2. Where the donee makes a statutory declaration within 3 months to the effect that he has not received any notice or information of the revocation of the power of attorney by death or otherwise, this will be regarded as conclusive proof of such non-revocation at the time when such payment or act was made or done.

**FORMAL PARTS OF A POWER OF ATTORNEY (You may be asked to draft a full POA in the Exam April 2019 Q 2b & 4a, August 2019 Q 4e)**

1. **Commencement Clause**–(Date is viewed as part of the commencement). BY THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY” Or simply “THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY”
2. **Date Clause**–should be left blank because if dated, one must register and stamp it within a certain period in order to avoid penalties. The presence of a false or impossible date does not invalidate the POA E.g. “**Made this……..…day of……..20……**”
3. **Recital Clause** – only necessary in Land matters where family head intends on executing a Power of Attorney for the transfer of rights in land.
4. **Appointment Clause**–this will have 3 things: name & address of donor; name & address of donee; and the fact that the donor appointed the donee. For example:

“I, ABC of 10, Abuja Close, Abuja, HEREBY appoint Mr XYZ (address should be here) to be my true and lawful Attorney and to act in my name and on my behalf…..

1. **Power and** **Authority Clause** –It provide thus:

“AND to do all things as I may lawfully do as follows**…(itemize the powers)**

1. **Omnibus/General Power Clause**:

“I declare that my attorney may do all other things that I may lawfully do which are necessary and incidental to the powers listed above”

1. **Irrevocability Clause -** To take the benefit of the statutory protection of third parties which has already been discussed, it is important that a clause should be inserted to the effect that:

“AND IT IS DECLARED that in consideration of the sum of N50, 000.00 (Fifty Thousand Naira) only paid to the donor by the donee (the receipt of which the donor hereby acknowledges) this Power of Attorney shall be irrevocable

**Or**

“AND I DECLARE that this Power of Attorney shall be irrevocable for a period of twelve months from this date.

1. **Testimonium Clause –** a clause is inserted thus:

“IN WITNESS OF WHICH THE DONOR HAS EXECUTED THIS DEED OF POWER OF ATTORNEY IN THE MANNER BELOW THE DAY AND YEAR FIRST ABOVE WRITTEN”

1. **Execution Clause:**

“SIGNED, SEALED AND DELIVERED by…… (Name of the Donor) (if it is by deed)

1. **Attestation and Authentication-**Attestation facilitates proof of execution. Attestation goes thus:

“IN THE PRESENCE OF”

Name….……………………………………………

Address……………………………………………

Occupation…………………………………………

Signature/MARK:………..…………………………

**FRANKING**
Prepared by:

**Information Needed From the Client for Drafting POA**

1. Particulars of the Donor and Donee
2. Purpose of the Power of Attorney (powers donated)
3. Whether or not it shall be expressed to be irrevocable
4. Whether or not it shall be given for valuable consideration and if yes, what is the consideration
5. Particulars of the properties covered by the POA

**Perfection of a Power of Attorney**

The perfection of Attorney is only restricted to stamping and registration. This is because no interest in land is transferred by power of attorney.

**STAMPING**

Generally, Power of Attorney attracts a **fixed stamp duty**. Stamping is necessary for it to be admissible in Court. It will be stamped 30 days after execution.

**REGISTRATION**

This depends on whether it qualifies as an instrument under the Land Instrument Registration Law applicable to the State where it is used. In most states, Power of Attorney is registrable within 60 days after its execution.

POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FROM POWER OF ATTORNEY

- - - 1. **Mr James intends to sell his house at Bwari Abuja but wants his younger sister to represent him in the transaction, advise him on what to do to ensure that his intentions are actualized.**

**Answer:** I will advise him to execute a power of attorney in favour of the sister**.**

- - - 1. **Mention 3 other instances that you may advise Mr James to take the same step above.**

**Answer:** list the circumstances when POA is required as stated in the note**.**

- - - 1. **Draft the instrument of appointment (August 2018 Q 2a, April 2019 Q 4a)** 2. **Assuming the donor sold the property before the donee could do so, comment on the validity of the sale. What is the implication of the sale in respect of the power of attorney?**

**Answer**: a donor has the legal right to deal directly with any property over which he had given a power of attorney; therefore the sale is valid**, _Chime v Chime._** The implication of the donor personally selling the property is that the power of attorney is impliedly revoked**.**

**CHAPTER FIVE**

**CONTRACT OF SALE OF LAND I & II**

This is one of the most important and frequently asked questions in the exam. It can form a full question and may appear in countless questions.

**Limitations to Acquisition of Interest in Land (January 2020 Q 6f)**

A person can acquire an interest in land either by inheritance, gift or by purchase. However, there are some restrictions to this right. It includes**:**

Age. Under **section 7** of the Land Use Act a person that is not up to 21 years of age cannot acquire interest in landed property directly.

Customary restrictions on transfer of customary or family lands without the consent of the communal or family head.

**Statutory restrictions**: for instance, **section 22** of the Land Use Act provides for the consent of the Governor to be obtained before any transfer of interest in land.

Town Planning Laws and Regulations

Restriction on transfer of land to foreigners without the approval of National Council of States; **section 46** Land Use Act.

Restriction on sale of lands belonging to statutory bodies or government agencies or ministries without the consent of the Minister; see **_Rocknoh Properties Ltd v NITEL PLC_**

Doctrine of _lis pendis._ Once there is a pending dispute in respect of title over a landed property, no sale of such land pending the dispute will be valid; **_Bua v Dauda_**

**Contractual Restrictions**

**TYPES OF CONTRACT OF SALE OF LAND**

1. **ORAL/PAROLE CONTRACT**: As the name implies, it is a sale of land without any written agreement. It is generally unenforceable in law by virtue of **section 4 of the Statute of Frauds** and **section 67 Property and Conveyancing Law**. A good example is Sale of land under customary law. This is because writing is not a requirement for sale of land under customary law; see **section 3 Law Reform (Contracts) Ac**t which expressly excludes sale under customary law; **_Alake v Awawa_.**

For oral sale of land under customary law to be valid, the following conditions must exist: **(August 2017 Q 3b)**

1. The purchase price must be paid fully,
2. Purchaser must take possession
3. Presence of at least two witnesses; see **_Adedeji v Oloso_**
4. **OPEN CONTRACT**: This is sale of land that is in writing but the parties only provides for the barest minimum requirement of the Statute of Frauds by providing for the **PARTIES**, the **PRICE** and the **PROPERTY** (the 3Ps). However, the terms of the sale are left out.

The agreement is also signed by both parties in other to create a binding effect. Several documents have been held to be examples of open contracts. In **_Akpara v UAC_**_:_ **a letter** was held to constitute an open contract. In **_Odusaga v Rickkets_**, **a Receipt** was held to be open contract; see also **_Yaya v Mogaji_**.

**Advantages/Implications of an Open Contract**: (August 2016 Q 1b)

1. It is binding on the parties
2. It is a sufficient act of part performance and can sustain an order for specific performance; **_Odusoga v Rickkets_.**
3. Death of any of the parties will not extinguish the contract.

**Disadvantages of Open Contract**

1. The important terms/covenants are orally agreed upon and left to be implied by law.
2. Also the purchaser does not have the opportunity to investigate the title of the vendor; **Paye _v Gaji_.**
3. It is more difficult to prove if dispute should arise.
4. The purchaser in most cases acquires only an equitable title over the property.
5. **FORMAL CONTRACT–**This is a modern form of sale of land wherein the parties pass through the formal stages laid down for legally transferring the legal interest to a purchaser**.** This is the preferred option which every legal practitioner should advice on.

**ADVANTAGES OF FORMAL CONTRACT**

This is important as they may ask you in exam to advice the parties on why they should enter into a formal contract of sale of land; **see Bar Final April 2018 Q 5a, August 2019 Q 5a, Dec 2020 Q 2a)**

1. The purchaser protects himself by having more time to investigate the title being transferred before the execution of the deed of conveyance.
2. The death of either party to the transaction does not terminate the contract as their personal representatives can proceed with the transaction and complete the sale –**_Yusuf v. Dada_.**
3. None of the parties can withdraw from the contract midstream without being liable for breach of the terms of the contract.
4. The terms of the contract having been expressly agreed to, the position and rights of the parties are express and not implied.
5. Fixtures and fittings may be transferred under a formal contract and it reduces the amount payable as stamp duty.
6. The vendor cannot unilaterally and subsequently increase the purchase price since this has already been fixed in the contract. Therefore prevents gazumping.
7. Parties may take special advantages under the contract by providing for specific matters they may not otherwise be able to do.
8. It is easier to enforce the terms of the contract.
9. Crystallizes the position of the parties at an early stage
10. May confer special advantages on either of the parties: for example, possession before completion

**Terms or Clauses in Formal Contract/Particulars of Sale**

1. **CAPACITY (in which vendor is conveying):** the vendor may convey as beneficial owner, trustee, mortgagee etc. it must be expressly stated. This determines covenants to be implied in to the conveyance at completion. In instances where a vendor conveys as a **BENEFICIAL OWNER** **(this is the preferable one**) for valuable consideration, (contract of sale and mortgage) 6 (six) covenants are implied by law. These are (**bar final August 2018 Q 1i)**–

**Implications of conveying as a beneficial owner - 7(a) and(b) CA, and Section100(1)(a), parts I and II 2 `<sup>`nd `</sup>` schedule PCL**

- - 1. That the vendor has the right to convey. 2. That the purchaser will have quiet enjoyment/possession. 3. That the property is free from encumbrances except those disclosed in the contract 4. Further assurance to indemnify the purchaser in the event of a claim by another claimant or the property

FOR LEASE, ADD THE ABOVE PLUS:

- - 1. That the lease is valid and subsisting; 2. the rent has been paid and the covenants of the lease performed/observed.

IMPLICATION FOR MORTGAGE:

1. The power of sale has become arising and exerciseable.
2. All conditions precedent have been complied with.
3. **DEPOSIT**: It is money paid by the purchaser as guarantee of his or her commitment to complete the made at the initial stage of the transaction. They must agree on the deposit which is usually 10% of the price.

**Importance of Payment of Deposit (Bar final August 2019 Q 5c, April 2018 Q 5bi)**

1. It ensures commitment on the side of the purchaser
2. It prevents the vendor from selling the property to another person
3. The purchaser will forfeit the deposit if he defaults.
4. It is also a sufficient act of part performance. UBA v TEJUMOLA & Sons

**Difference Between a Deposit and Part-Payment:**

1. A deposit is a mere security/show of commitment on the part of the purchaser to complete the transaction in due course.
2. Part payment presupposes that the contract is concluded and binding
3. Part payment is a part of the agreed purchase price while deposit will form part of the purchase price if the transaction succeeds
4. Part payment is always recoverable while deposit will be forfeited if the purchaser defaults; **_Edosa v Zacalla_**

**Capacity For Which A Solicitor May Hold Deposit (Exam Focus)**

The solicitor may hold the deposit either as an **AGENT** or a **STAKEHOLDER**; **_Rockeagle Ltd v ALSOP_.**

If he takes as an Agent:

1. He receives the money on behalf of the vendor or as agent of the vendor only.
2. The solicitor is bound to remit the money to the vendor.
3. The solicitor is liable to pay interest on the deposit.
4. The vendor is liable to the purchaser where the deposit is misappropriated. **_Sorrel V Finch_**

If he takes as a Stakeholder, he will be acting as an agent of both parties. This is **PREFERABLE** because he is not obliged to release the money for either of the parties until the party is obliged to take it. Also he will be entitled to keep any interest accruing from keeping the deposit; **(Dec 2020 Q 3f). ALTERNATIVELY**

1. The solicitor is the trustee of the money.
2. The solicitor has personal responsibility to keep the money safe.
3. The solicitor will be liable for any loss of the money.
4. The solicitor is not liable to pay interest on the deposit.
5. The solicitor is liable to pay the money to vendor in the event of default by the purchaser to complete the transaction.
6. The solicitor is to pay the money to the purchaser where it is the vendor’s default in completing the transaction
7. The solicitor becomes becomes an interpleader and he is obliged to pay the party who eventually becomes entitled to it:

If the contract fails he hands over the deposit to whosoever is entitled depending who was responsible for the failure.(If it’s the fault of the purchaser the deposit is handed over to the vendor and if that of the vendor it is handed over to the purchaser). **_Sorrel V Finch_**

**NOTE**: The Solicitor is expected to deposit the money into the client’s account and avoid mixing same with his personal money; **Rule 23 RPC**.

1. **BALANCE AND INTEREST ON UNPAID BALANCE**: The balance is paid at completion. Where purchaser is in default, interest is chargeable, which is 4% at common law. See **_Esadile v Stephenson_**. However, it is advisable to provide for the going rate (commercial rate or CBN rate, usually 11-12%). If this is not expressly provided for in the contract of sale, then common law rate of 4% applies.
2. **DATE OF COMPLETION**: Generally, time is not of the essence in a contract of sale of land. It is usually completed within reasonable time; **_Reynolds Const. Co v Edomwonyi_**. The term ‘within a reasonable time’ is ambiguous and usually subjective. It is advisable for the parties to provide for an actual time in order to make time of the essence. Also see **_Johnson v Humphrey._**

However, where the vendor makes a deposit or part payment, he will be required to complete the transaction within a reasonable time. This is because if he fails to do so, the vendor will be entitled to repudiate/terminate the transaction and may sell the land to another person. **(See January 2020 Q 2a-b)**

1. **PAYMENT FOR FITTINGS AND CHATTELS**: The parties may agree on a separate price for fixtures and fittings (this is where the land is to be sold with a building on it), it reduces the amount payable as stamp duties since the document is stamped **_ad_** **_volerem_** (i.e. according to the value).
2. **POSSESSION BEFORE COMPLETION**: Generally, in a contract of sale of land, the purchaser is not entitled to take possession until completion when he has paid full purchase price. However, parties may agree otherwise. It is advisable to let in purchaser as a licencee so that in default, you don’t have to go through rigorous process of recovery of property; **_Odutola v. Paper Sack Nig. LTD_; April 2018 Q 5b**

**EXCHANGE OF CONTRACT**

This is the procedure by which a contract of sale of land is made binding on the parties. Without exchange, the contract will not be binding on the parties.

**The Procedure for Exchange of Contract is as follows:**

1. Vendor’s Solicitor prepares the contract of sale and sends a copy to the purchaser’s solicitor for perusal and any amendment.
2. The purchaser’s solicitor on approval (or amendment) sends the copy back to the vendor’s solicitor who then engrosses the document after effecting the necessary corrections;
3. The vendor’s solicitor will produce two plain copies and send a copy to the purchaser’s solicitor for signing while he retains the other copy for the vendor to sign;
4. When the purchaser signs, the rule is that he moves to the vendor by taking his own signed copy to the vendor’s solicitor together with the deposit in exchange for the vendor’s signed copy.
5. The exchange takes place in the vendor’s place or vendor’s solicitor’s office or exchange can be by post, email, telephone, fax depending on what is agreed by the parties.

**NOTE: Exchange is not required where one solicitor acts for both parties.**

**When one Solicitor May Act for Both Parties:**

Generally, a single solicitor should not act for both parties in order to avoid conflict of interest **(Rule 17 RPC)** but there are instances that the law allows a single solicitor to act for both parties.

**When a solicitor can act for both parties** (**Bar final August 2019 Q 3c, April 2019 Q 2b, Dec 2020 Q 6c)**

1. Where the title to the property is sound
2. Where there is no likelihood of conflict btw the parties e.g. company and its subsidiary, relatives (existing relationship btw the parties)
3. Where the transaction is of no serious legal consequence (small value)
4. Where the term of the contract had been fully negotiated and agreed upon by the parties
5. Exchange then takes place once the parties have signed the document, no need for physical exchange (**_Smith v Mansi_**)

**EFFECT OF EXCHANGE OF CONTRACT**

1. Upon exchange of contract, the contract takes effect and becomes binding on the parties; **_Domb v Isoz_**
2. The purchaser immediately acquires an equitable interest on the property.
3. None of the parties can rescind the transaction without attracting liability.
4. The Vendor becomes a qualified trustee in favour of the purchaser if he is still in possession.
5. Death of any of the parties will not vitiate the transaction as their personal representatives can step in and complete the transaction; **_Gwangwan v Gagare_**

**PERFECTION OF CONTRACT OF SALE AGREEMENT**

**STAMPING**

- Contract of sale carries a fixed stamp duty
- Failure to stamp the document will attract penalty or fine.
- An unstamped document cannot be evidence to prove title. However the document be used in Court to prove that money had been received.

**REGISTRATION**

- Contract of sale is registerable; **_Okoye v Dumez_**
- Effect of non-registration is that the contract would be inadmissible to prove title **_Abraham v Adetutu_**.
- It also governs priority among competing interests.

**STEPS/STAGES IN THE SALE OF LAND (Bar final August 2017 Q 1a, August 2018 Q 5ii & 2019 Q 5b, January 2020 Q 6d)**

In the case of **_International Textile Industries (Nig.) Limited v. Aderemi_** the stages of transfer of interest in land was summarized into 3 stages: Contract stage, Completion stage, Post-completion stage: stamping and registration.

**GENERALLY**, the stages of contract of Sale of Land are categorized into 5 and it includes:

- - - 1. **PRE-CONTRACT STAGE** which involves

1. preliminary enquiry and
2. negotiation of price.
   - - 1. **CONTRACT** **STAGE** which involves
3. Agreement on terms of sale
4. Preparation and execution of formal contract of sale and
5. exchange of contract.
   - - 1. **POST CONTRACT STAGE** which involves
6. deducing of title by the vendor or his solicitor and
7. investigation of vendor’s title by the purchaser or his solicitor.
8. Raising requisitions if necessary
   - - 1. **COMPLETION STAGE** which involves
9. preparation and execution of the deed of assignment
10. and transfer of title documents to the assignee.
    - - 1. **POST COMPLETION STAGE** which involves perfection of the deed of assignment by
11. obtaining the governor’s consent,
12. stamping and
13. registration of the deed of assignment.

**DEDUCING OF TITLE**

HOW A VENDOR CAN DEDUCE TITLE

CA states: **40 years** but in Abia it has been reduced to **30 years**

PCL states: **30 years.**

In Lagos state, the right of an owner of land becomes extinguished after **12** years of adverse possession. See MAJEKODUNMI V ABINA

LAGOS: Under the LIMS there is no need for the vendor to deduce his title, since the purchaser could on mere inspection of the register discover the vendor’s power and right to sell and the presence or otherwise of any encumbrance. See ONAGORUWA V AKINREMI

1. abstract of title and
2. epitome of title.

One means of deducing title is by the vendor producing the **abstract/epitome of title**, which are both documents of summary evidence of the history and types of the title of the vendor.

In **_Oakden v. Pike_,** the court defined abstract of title as a document, which contains with sufficient clearness and sufficient fullness the effect of every instrument, which constitutes part of the vendor’s title.

**Epitome of Title** contains a schedule of documents and events, which constitute the title and is accompanied by photocopies of the documents. Modern method used today.

**Abstract of Title** is the chronological history of how the land came into possession of the vendor. It must connect and there must be no discrepancies in the history.

**ADVANTAGES OF ABSTRACT/EPITOME OF TITLE**

1. It provides prima facie evidence to the purchaser if there are any defects in the vendor’s title.
2. It helps the purchaser in raising requisitions of title (requisition of title is a demand to the vendor to clarify certain queries by the purchaser).
3. It is very useful to the purchaser’s solicitor when he is writing the report on title.

**What Constitutes A Good Root of Title (January 2020 Q 2f)**

This is a document of title, which is sufficient in itself without any extrinsic evidence to establish the title to the land. Such document must contain the following features:

1. The document is genuine;
2. It must establish both the legal and equitable ownership of the land.
3. It must adequately describe the property.
4. It must clearly state or describe the owner.
5. Nothing on the face of it to cast doubt on its authenticity (integrity)
6. It must not be subject to a higher interest; **_Akinduro v Alaya_**

**Examples of A Good Root of Title (Exam Focus)**

1. A Deed of Assignment (registered)
2. A Deed of Legal Mortgage (registered)
3. A Deed of Gift.
4. Assent
5. Certificate of purchase: it certifies the sale of land pursuant to court process

**Documents that Constitute Bad Root of Title**

1. A Will: except is admitted to probate. It can even be challenge
2. A Deed of Lease
3. Power of attorney – **Ude v Nwara**
4. An Equitable mortgage
5. A Power of Attorney
6. Certificate of Occupancy: it only raises the presumption that the holder is in possession which can be displaced by evidence of better title **_Ogunleye v Oni_**_._ However, if the C of O is in respect of a state grant or issue pursuant to a deed statutory right of occupancy, then it is a good root of title.

**INVESTIGATION OF TITLE**

The purchaser’s solicitor should investigate the title to the vendor after the vendor has deduced his title. Thus, the practice is that as soon as the purchaser receives the abstract/epitome of title, the purchaser should proceed to verify the authenticity and genuineness of the documents relied on by the vendor to establish his title.

**Various Ways of Investigating Title (Exam focus)**

There is need to conduct a search on the title. After obtaining the epitome and abstract of title the purchaser’s solicitor can conduct searches in the following places –

1. **Searches at the Lands Registry–**This will reveal whether the vendor is actually the registered owner.

The procedure to conduct search in Abuja Geographical Information System (AGIS) is:

1. A written application to conduct a search should be made to the AGIS stating the particulars of the property. Accompanied by:
2. a letter of consent by the owner of the title authorising the purchaser’s solicitor to conduct the search of the file/property or affidavit in lieu
3. evidence of payment of search fee
4. Submit the items at AGIS
5. Officials of AGIS conducted the search and a report is issued and delivered to the solicitor

**PROCEDURE FOR SEARCH UNDER LIMS (Lagos)**

1. Application in the prescribed form (Form 3) and payment of the prescribed fee. Application and payment could be made online.
2. Review/consideration of application by Registrar or upon Registrar’s instructions.
3. Issuance of official search report by the Registrar as in Form 4. see section 22(5) Lagos state Land Registration Law
4. **Search at the Companies Registry –** This is in situations where the vendor or past owner is a company incorporated under CAMA, apart from the searches at the land registry, there should be a further search at the Corporate Affairs Commission. E.g. need to know whether the articles of association allow the company to deal with the property the way it intends to.
5. **Search at Probate Registry –** This is a search conducted to reveal whether or not probate has been granted in relation to a land and who are the personal representatives.
6. **Traditional Evidence –** This is a search conducted on the principal members of a family land or on the community and heads of the community where the property is not subject to family or community ownership, to confirm that all relevant consents were obtained and that the title is neither void nor voidable.
7. **Physical Inspection –** This is a personal visit to the title in question in order to find out if there is any issue, or to find out for yourself the actual size of the land and whether it conforms to the dimensions of the land registry or if it is squatted _._
8. **Court Registry–** This is a search conducted to see if the land is subject to any court litigation or if the title is based on a Court issued certificate.

**Summary of the Procedure To Investigate Title**

If you are asked in the exam to state the steps you will take to investigate title in the exam, this is the answer you will give**; September 2015 Q 3d, August 2019 Q 5d Dec 2020 Q 2b)**

1. Obtain/examine the epitome and abstract of title from the vendor
2. Conduct physical inspection of the land by visiting the location
3. Conduct search in the following places;
4. Land Registry
5. Probate Registry
6. Court Registry
7. Corporate Affair Commission for companies
8. Carry out family/communal enquiries if the land is a family or communal land.
9. Raise requisitions on areas that are ambiguous if any arising from the investigation
10. Observation of the replies to the requisition
11. Prepare a search report and send to the purchaser.

**Contents of A Search Report (August 2016 Q 6d, 2018 Q 1ix, 2019 Q 5d)**

1. Letter head of the legal practitioner and address of the client
2. Title of the search report
3. Date of search
4. Place of search
5. Name of owner
6. Particulars of The property
7. nature of interest
8. Encumbrances
9. Comments/recommendation
10. Name and signature
11. Valuation report (for Mortgage only)

(**NOTE** you may asked to draft the Search Report)

**REQUISITION OF TITLE**

If in the course of investigation of the title of the vendor at the places suggested for investigation, questions arise in the mind of the purchaser’s solicitor; he has a right to make a requisition. This he can do by asking questions aimed at clearing the ambiguity.

If you are asked in the exam to raise requisitions over any title, you can ask any reasonable question depending on the abstract of title. For example, assuming one of the title documents is an Assent or Deed of mortgage, you can ask the following questions:

- - - 1. Has probate been granted over the Will? 2. Are you the sole beneficiary in the Will? 3. Can I see a copy of the probate? 4. Has the mortgage been discharged? 5. Was a deed of discharged given to you by the Bank?

**Importance Pre-Contract Enquiries/Why you should Investigate Vendor’s Title (See August 2017 Q 6c, April 2018 Q 5a, August 2019 Q 2iii & Q 4f)**

1. To ascertain whether the vendor has a good root of title.
2. To discover patent defects on the land which physical inspection will reveal.
3. To avoid future disputes and lawsuits.
4. To ensure the property is free from encumberances
5. To ensure that the vendor’s title is clearly registered.
6. To avoid the application of constructive notice.
7. To ensure that the land is not subject to any pending dispute.
8. To ensure that the requisite consents or authority were obtained in the case of family or communal land.

**The Effects of Failure to Investigate the Vendor’s Title**

1. The purchaser may acquire bad root of title.
2. The doctrine of constructive notice may be imputed on the purchaser.
3. There is highly likelihood of future dispute arising from the transaction.
4. The legal practitioner may be liable for professional negligence. **_Rondel v Worsely_**

**COMPLETION OF SALE OF LAND PROCEDURE**

This entails the procedure of preparing the deed of assignment or conveyance, and execution of the deed. It is usually preceded by a completion (financial) statement.

The completion stage means that the purchaser has accepted the title offered by the vendor, or at least, he has waived his right to any objection on title. The completion stage signifies cash for the vendor and keys (possession) to the purchaser.

The procedure is: **(April 2019 Q 2a(iv))**

1. Preparation of deed of assignment/conveyance by purchaser’s solicitor.
2. Vetting of deed of assignment by vendor’s solicitor.
3. Engrossed copies (several original copies) to be made by purchaser’s solicitor.
4. Payment of outstanding purchase price, if any.
5. Execution of deed of assignment by both parties.
6. Surrender of original title documents by vendor to purchaser (including keys, if developed); and notice of change of ownership to tenants if already occupied by tenants.
7. Assignment of insurance policy if any.

**COMPLETION STATEMENT**

This is also termed _“financial statement”._ It is prepared by the solicitors. It gives a financial record of the transaction between the vendor and the purchaser. It shows the amount of money to be expected by the vendor at completion. Thus, it is a statement conveying the financial position of the parties to the transaction.

A completion statement should contain the following –

1. The sum being paid or received in respect of the transaction;
2. An accurate and full statement of all disbursements. For example, to valuers, surveyors, and other professionals, fees, taxes, and other expenses;
3. The solicitor’s charges;
4. The final amount to be paid before completion or to be paid after completion.
5. Taxes and other fees to be paid

**What Amounts To Completion for Vendor Consists of:**

1. Conveying a good root of title in the property to the purchaser.
2. Delivering up actual possession and enjoyment.

**Whilst, What Amounts To Completion for Purchaser Consists of:**

1. Accepting the title.
2. Taking possession of the title documents and the deed.
3. Obtaining a draft for the payment of the balance of purchase price.
4. Taking possession.

**Documents to Be Collected on Completion by the Purchaser from the Vendor (April 2019 NO. 2A (iii))**

1. Copies of the duly executed deed of assignment (with survey plan attached, as it is a requirement of law that survey plan be attached).
2. All original title documents (except where there is an acknowledgment for production and undertaking for safe custody)
3. Receipt of payment of all outgoings e.g. ground rents, rates and taxes
4. Where the property is sold subject to tenancies, the vendor should hand over a letter to be delivered to the tenants notifying them that the property has been sold to the purchaser. Henceforth he is entitled to rent.
5. Duly executed form for Governor’s consent
6. Original Power of Attorney if the conveyance was made pursuant to the Power of Attorney.

**PERFECTION OF TITLE (August 2017 Q 6e, January 2020 Q 5d)**

- - - 1. **GOVERNOR’S CONSENT**

Under section **22 LUA** and the case of **SAVANAH BANK V AJILO** where the consent of the Governor is not sought and obtained the transaction will be null and void

The steps taken to apply for a Governor’s consent may vary from State to State – generally, it will involve:

1. The application should be made in the prescribed form and signed by the purchaser and the vendor.
2. The application form should be submitted with the following –
3. A covering letter addressed to appropriate authority.
4. Evidence of payment of the prescribed consent fee.
5. Current tax clearance certificate of the two parties.
6. Where one of the parties is a corporate body, the corporate body must supply the revenue certificate papers for its staff remitted to government and the current tax clearance certificates for the directors.
7. In the case of a developed property, there shall be a requirement for the building plan.
8. Six (6) copies of the Deed of Assignment
9. Evidence of up to date payment of ground rent and legal charges.
10. A Certified True Copy (CTC) of the assignor’s land document obtainable from the Lands registry.

    - - 1. **STAMPING**

Deed of assignment must be stamped ad valorem within 30 days of execution S.23(3) SDA. Where the parties are natural persons duty is paid to the sate board of internal revenue (SBIR), when it’s a company its to be paid to the federal government at federal inland revenue service (FIRS)

**Effect of Failure to pay stamp duties–**

1. The instrument will not be accepted for registration; and
2. The instrument will be inadmissible in evidence in court; the court may still admit it if the stamp duties are paid–**Section 22 SDA**
3. There is penalty for late stamping.
   - - 1. **REGISTRATION**

Deed of assignment is a registrable instrument and must be registered within 60 days of execution:

**Importance of Registering Title Documents is – (Jan 2020 Q 2c)**

1. It is an Notice that the title is encumbered.
2. It gives priority, that is, the first in time will prevail where there are rival instruments that are registered.
3. Where an instrument is not registered, it cannot be pleaded because it is inadmissible in evidence. and the courts cannot give effect to it, that is, it cannot be used as a document of title to land–**_Akinduro v. Alaya_**

**POSSIBLE EXAM QUESTIONS FROM SALE OF LAND**

- - - 1. Mr. James gave a written note to Chief Nath acknowledging receipt of the sum of N1 Million being part payment for his property situate at Asaba, Delta State. However, before the parties could complete the transaction, Mr. James died in an accident.

1. **What is the nature and implication of the receipt given to Chief Nath by Mr. James?**
2. **State the effect if any of the death of Mr. James to the transaction**.

**Answer**: The nature of the receipt is that it is an open contract of sale of land. The implication is that the contract is binding and enforceable against the parties.

Secondly, Mr. James death will not affect the transaction because his personal representatives will complete the transaction.

- - - 1. **Advise the parties on why they should execute a formal contract of sale before completion of the transaction**. 2. **State 4 reasons why you should investigate the title of the vendor** 3. **Assuming the parties intends to retain your services as their solicitor, advise the parties on whether it is possible for you to represent both parties**.

Answer: Generally, it is not advisable for one solicitor to act for both parties. However, it is possible where the vendor’s title is sound, the terms are clearly stated, there is no likelihood of dispute and the consideration is small.

**CHAPTER SIX**

**LEASES 1 & II**

A lease is a temporary transfer or grant of possessory interest in a property to another (lessee) by the owner (lessor) for a definite time in consideration for rent which may be money or money’s worth. The lessor retains a reversionary interest in the leased property.

**Essential Elements of a Valid Lease (Jan 2020 Q 5b, Dec 2020 Q 4a) OSHO V. FOREIGN FINANCE CORPORATION**

1. **Certainty of Parties:** Being a contractual transaction, parties must be juristic persons and must be adequately described. **_UBA v Tejumola & Sons; Bosah v. Oji_**
2. **Certainty of Property:** The property must be in existence at the commencement date and must be sufficiently described, otherwise, nothing is demised and the agreement is void.
3. **Certainty of Term:** There must be definite time frame where the lease will commence and the time it will come to an end. The lease cannot inure in perpetuity. **_Okechukwu v Onuorah_**_:_ **_UBA v. Tejumola & Sons Ltd_**

**NOTE**: The lease may be expressed to take effect upon the happening or occurrence of an ascertainable future event or contingency which is certain in time to occur**_;_** **_Okechukwu v. Onuorah, Bosah v. Oji_.** In such circumstance the lease will become valid if the event or contingency occurs

1. **Exclusive Possession-**There must be exclusive possession by the lessee; **_Osho v. FFC & Anor_.** This is so even against the lessor unless there is a clause allowing the lessor to enter the premises for the purposes of checking or effecting repairs. UMEZURIKE V.GEORGE. A document that purports to be a lease, but does not confer exclusive possession is not a lease. _CLORE V. THEATRICAL PROPERTIES LTD_
2. **The lease must be created in the proper manner–**if the lease is for a period above 3 years, it must be created by deed but if it is 3 years or below then it need not be by deed but by a tenancy agreement.

**Difference Between a Lease and Sale of Land**

1. lease is the transfer of occupation or possession but lessor retains the title while assignment is the transfer of the title of land/ownership to the assignee
2. A **lease** is granted for a period of term while in **an assignment,** the assignee receives the entirety of the estate from the assignor.
3. In a **lease,** lessor has reversionary interest while in **an assignment,** there is no reversionary interest retained by grantor.
4. In a **lease,** all covenants in the head lease (express and implied) bind parties to a lease while in **an assignment** only covenants that touch and concern the land in the head lease binds assignees
5. In a **lease,** it may not require deed depending on the duration and mode of creation while in **an assignment,** it always require a deed for legal title to be passed to the assignee.
6. In lease the parties are called lessor/lessee but in assignment the parties are called assignor/assignee.

**RENT IN LEASE**

This is the consideration (compensation) paid by the tenant to the landlord for the term granted. Payment of rent is not a strict requirement of a valid lease. A main feature of a lease is lawful occupation by tenant whether the person pays rent or not is immaterial –**_African Petroleum Ltd. v. Owodunni._**

**TYPES OF RENT: (January 2020 Q 2g)**

1. **Rack Rent**: this is an economic rent charged and paid for the improvements and developments on the land
2. **Premium Rent**: This is a lump sum usually paid in addition to other rents. It is considered as a fine and therefore prohibited in some states.
3. **Ground Rent**: it is rent paid to the government over the bare land itself.

**MODES OF COLLECTING RENT**

Rent may be charged in **ARREARS** (at the end of the term granted) or in **ADVANCE** (before the end of the term granted). However, **it is not** advisable to charge rent in advance for the following reasons: **(April 2018 Q 5dii, April 2019 Q 3d)**

1. **Tax implications –** This can be found under **section 3(3) of the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA), 2004.** It provides that a landlord who collects rent in advance for a period exceeding five (5) years is liable to pay higher tax than when the rent is for five years or below.
2. **Inflation –**Where a landlord collects many years rent in advance will not be able to review the rent for such period and this may turn out to be disadvantageous because inflation may make the rent collected virtually useless.
3. Also in Lagos state, collecting rent in advance for more than one year is a crime and attracts a fine of **N100, 000.00 or three months imprisonment** upon conviction.

**COVENANTS IN LEASES**

These are agreements creating obligations usually in a deed. Promises and pledges made by parties to a lease.

**TYPES OF COVENANTS**

1. Implied covenants
2. Usual covenants
3. Express covenants
   - - 1. **IMPLIED COVENANTS:**

Essential covenants implied/inferred by law whether the lease or tenancy agreement makes provision for them.

**Implied Covenants On The Part of The Landlord/Lessor:**

1. Quiet enjoyment i.e. not to disrupt tenant from enjoyment of the property
2. Non-derogation from grant/title
3. Property must be fit for human habitation
4. Compliance with relevant laws guiding recovery of premises (notices) i.e. no room for self-help

**Implied Covenants On The Part of The Tenant:**

1. Payment of rent
2. Payment of rates and taxes-NEPA/PHCN
3. Covenant not to commit waste
4. Keep and deliver the premises in a tenantable condition-**_Warren v. Keen_**
5. Allow landlord to enter premises for repairs

- - - 1. **USUAL COVENANTS**

Usual covenants are proper and common covenants inserted in a lease based on the facts or evidence presented before the court.

**Usual covenants include:**

1. Quiet enjoyment of the property
2. Payment of rent
3. Payment of taxes except those expressly stated to be payable by the Landlord
4. Maintain and deliver up property in a good state of repairs
5. Allow Landlord a right to view the state of repairs
   - - 1. **EXPRESS COVENANTS**

Express covenants are covenants which will not be implied in the lease or enforced by the parties **except** there is express or definite agreement on them. This is most the exam focus areas.

**Example of Express Covenants:**

In the exam, there are three ways of asking questions on these covenants**.**

- - - 1. **You may be asked to draft the covenant or** 2. **The covenant will be improperly drafted and you will be asked to comment or** 3. **You may be asked to list the contents of the covenants**.

**COVENANT TO PAY RENT /RENT CLAUSE**

**RATIONALE-**A lease should provide for the payment of rent. The rent must be certain or ascertainable, it is either money or money’s worth and generally payable in arrears unless otherwise stated. Once rent has been agreed upon, neither of the parties can unilaterally alter the clause; **_Yahaya v Chukwuma_.**

**DRAFT- (**This may also be referred to as **REDDENDUM)**

“YIELDING/PAYING as rent the yearly sum of ………..clear of all deductions by yearly payments in advance; the first of such payment having been made on the…..day of…..20…….”

**Remedies for failure to pay rent include:**

1. An action in court to recover the money
2. An action in distress- i.e. the seizure of the Lessee’s goods to satisfy the rent without going to court.
3. An action for forfeiture where contained in the lease
4. A claim for _mesne_ profit against a tenant at sufferance

**COVENANT TO PAY RATES AND OUTGOINGS**

Usually **recurrent rates** and outgoings like bills, light bills, waste disposal bills etc. are to be paid by the **Lessee/Tenant** while **non-recurrent bills** like fixing of electric poles etc. are to be paid by the Lessor/Landlord.

Ordinarily, the lessee is only bound to pay the rates he met as at the time he entered the premises and not future rates unless it was expressly included in the covenant. In drafting this clause, it should be made wide enough to accommodate future outgoings; **(Dec 2020 Q 4b)**

If there is no express covenant on who is to pay the rates and outgoings**, section 7(2)** of **the Tenancy Law of Lagos** will apply and the tenant is to make all payment on rates and outgoings.

**SAMPLE DRAFT-(April 2019 Q 1 Bii, Dec 2020 Q 4bii)**

“The lessee covenants to pay all rates and taxes, levies, duties, outgoings and charges payable on the demised premises now or as may be subsequently imposed on the property whether payable by the Landlord or not”.

**Remedies for Breach of Covenant to Pay Rates and Outgoings**

1. An action to recover the outgoings and rates that have accrued.
2. An action for damages
3. An action for forfeiture and re-entry where the lease contains a provision to that effect.

**USER COVENANT OR COVENANT ON USE**

This covenant stipulates the use for which the demised premises will be put by the lessee**.** If this is not stated, the demised premises can only be used by **the lessee** for any lawful purpose.-**_Dawodu v. Odulaja._**

**Purpose/Usefulness of the Covenant:**

1. It protects the property against nuisance.
2. It helps the **lessor** control use and purpose of the property.
3. To prevent use of property for unlawful or immoral purpose.
4. To protect the reversionary interest of the lessor.
5. To ensure compliance with town planning laws and user covenants on title documents.

**NOTE: Landlord’s Remedy for Breach:**

1. The lessor can seek an order of Injunction restraining the lessee from using the property for a purpose prohibited.
2. Sue for damages for misuse of the property.
3. Right of forfeiture and re-entry if contained in the lease.

**SAMPLE DRAFT: see January 2020 Q 1f**

“The lessee covenants to make use of the demised premises and to permit the premises to be used for the purpose of residence/commerce/agriculture only”

**As Lessor’s Solicitor, Note the Following Points about User Covenant:**

It does not always favour the **lessor/landlord. This is because** the more restricted the use of the property is, the less likelihood of the lessee letting the premises.

**So advice the lessor this will be your advice i.e. that the covenant should not be strict it should not be strict**).

**COVENANT TO REPAIR**

It is also an implied term of a tenancy that the tenant is to keep the premises in constant tenantable repairs with the exemption of reasonable wear and tear.

**Who has the obligation to Repair?**

Any of the party may carry out the repairs but it still depends on the type of repairs as follows:

- - 1. **Structural repairs** like repairs on the roof, house foundation, walls, pillars etc. are to be done by the Lessor/ Landlord. **S. 8(vi) of the Tenancy Law of Lagos State**. 2. **Internal repairs** like bad sinks, broken floor, toiler seat, kitchen cupboard, painting, changing locks etc. are to be repaired by **the tenant/lessee.**

**Points A Solicitor Should Note While Drafting the Covenant:**

1. The structural repairs to be done must be itemised in the draft.
2. The draft should contain the lessor’**s** right of entry to inspect repairs.
3. The draft must exclude fair wear and tear.

**SAMPLE DRAFT:**

“**The Lessee covenants to keep and maintain the demised premises in a good state of repair fair wear and tear expected and to permit the lessor to enter at all reasonable time to view the state of repair of the demised premises.”**

**Purpose/Usefulness of the Covenant to Repair**

1. It protects the premises against waste committed by the tenant.
2. It maintains the value of the property.
3. It preserves **tenant’s** enjoyment of the premises by maintaining same in a habitable condition.

**Remedies for Breach of Covenant to Repair**

1. Serve a notice to repair on the tenant
2. Re-entry and forfeiture of the lease.
3. An action for specific performance
4. Action for damages

**COVENANT NOT TO MAKE ALTERATIONS**

It may be drafted thus:

“The tenant covenants not to make any addition or alteration to the premises without the written consent of the Landlord, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld and to restore the property to its original position at the end of the term of the lease at his own expense”.

**USEFULNESS-**

1. Safeguards the premises and lessor’s reversion
2. Enhances lessee’s use or enjoyment of the property.
3. **COVENANT TO INSURE (Very Important)**

This is an undertaking to insure the demised premises by one of the parties to the lease or in the name of one or all of the parties. It is always asked in the exam both in theory and in the MCQ. (**see MCQ Dec 2020 Q 6 & 20)**

**CONTENTS of Insurance Covenant: WRACA (April 2019 Q 2c(d))**

1. Who is to insure
2. Risk to be insured
3. Amount of insurance cover
4. Application of the insurance money and
5. The insurance company

**Sample Draft**

‘The Lessee is to insure the property in the joint names of the lessor and lessee against fire and flood with NICON Insurance Co. Ltd (RC NO 9999) to the tune of N10, 000,000 (ten million naira) and make payment of all premium on the policy and in the event of the property being damaged, all money received in respect of the insurance shall be used to reinstate the property. If reinstatement is not possible, the sum will be shared PRO RATA between the parties’.

**Factors That Determine Who Is To Insure: (This is usually asked in the exam, so take note)**

1. Existing Obligations on the Property
2. The Nature of the Property
3. The use of which the Property will be used.
4. Any other agreement in the lease

**Application of Insurance Money:** How money will be collected from insurance and how the money will be applied depends on the following factors:

- **Where Reinstatement Is Possible:** Generally, where the **Landlord** insures, the tenant cannot compel the landlord to use insurance money to re-build the premises or to restrain the landlord from suing for rents until the premises are rebuilt. -**_Leeds v Cheetham_**. However, where the tenant insures or reimburses the landlord, he **can compel** the landlord to use insurance money to reinstate the property. **_Munford Hotels Ltd. v Wheeler;_**
- **Where Reinstatement Is Impossible:** Where reinstatement is not possible, the insurance money will be shared **PRO RATA** (equal measure).

**USEFULNESS**

1. Protects the property and the reversion
2. In the event of loss, provides for reinstatement of the property
3. Provides for the sharing formula where reinstatement is not possible.
4. **COVENANT AGAINST ASSIGNMENT/SUB-LET**

A tenant has the unrestricted right to assign his tenancy or to create subleases of such tenancy in the absence of a provision to the contrary-**_Keeves v. Dean_**

**RATIONALE**\-This covenant ensures that the Landlord is in control of tenants occupying the premises.

**Types/Forms Covenant against Assignment**

- 1. **Absolute Bar/Prohibition:** An example of an absolute bar is:

“The Tenant/Lessee shall not assign or part with possession of the demised premises”.

**IMPLICATION-**This is harsh on the lessee as it does not protect his interest at all. Thus, it is not a good way to draft the clause.

- 1. **Conditional /Qualified Prohibition:** An example of this clause is drafted thus:

“The lessee shall not assign sublet, charge or part with possession of the premises or any part of it without the written consent of the Landlord”.

**IMPLICATION-**It is not good enough as the test for granting or refusing consent is subjective and landlord is not bound to disclose why he does not allow the tenant to sublet etc.

**NOTE**: In the exam, an incomplete draft of the covenant may be given and you will be asked to criticize it and also re-draft it. In which case, the **comments** made **above** and the **draft** given **below** will be your answer.

- 1. **Balanced/Ideal Clause:** this is the preferred one for you to draft in your exams; **see January 2020 Q 1f, Dec 2020 Q 4bii**

“The lessee shall not assign, underlet, charge or otherwise part with the possession of the demised premises or any part of it without the written consent of the landlord on every occasion first obtained and such consent not to be unreasonably withheld in the case of reasonable and responsible persons”.

**IMPLICATION-**It is used to ensure a balance of the competing interests of the parties. Landlord can only refuse for reasons known to law and tenant must always get consent before subletting etc.

**USEFULNESS**

1. Helps guide against nuisance to neighbours
2. Prevents subletting/assigning of property to persons who would use it for illegal or immoral purposes
3. Helps to protect the lessor’s reversionary interest
4. Enables the lessee recoup part of his expenses or money expended on the property.

**Remedies of the Lessor Upon Breach of the Covenant:**

1. Claim of damages
2. Action for forfeiture
3. Entry into the demised premises to carry out repairs
4. Action for specific performance of the covenants

**What Amounts To Reasonable and Responsible Persons**

A reasonable and respectable/responsible person has been held to mean a person with a **good financial standing; _see Alakija v John Holts Ltd._**

Where the lessor refuses consent to sublet to reasonable and respectable persons, the lessee may:

1. Go ahead and sublet and obtain an injunction restraining the lessor from interfering or
2. He can also bring an action for the refusal to be declared unreasonable by the court; **See _Nigerian Land & Sea Food Ltd. v. Roadside Engineering Foundry Ltd._**

**For the refusal to be reasonable, it must be based on any of the following grounds:**

1. The personality of the intended user; i.e. whether he has good financial standing.
2. The nature of the property is such that subletting same will be improper
3. The use the property will be put by the intended user is against the user covenant agreed by the parties (**see January 2020 1g)**

**PROVISOS/CLAUSES IN A LEASE**

- - - 1. **OPTION TO RENEW CLAUSE**

This is **a lessor’s covenant** made to the **lessee** that at the expiration of the lease and a new lease will be created for similar or reviewed terms, rents and covenants (as agreed upon by both parties based on certain conditions e.g. that the tenant complied with covenants in the lease).

Where an option to renew is not included there is a risk of a perpetually renewable lease created. Re Hopkins

**It is ordinarily in favour of the lessee (Dec 2020 Q 4f)**

**PURPOSE-**This may prevent the drafting of a new Deed of Lease or Tenancy Agreement.

**Contents of the Option to Renew Clause (you may be asked to list the content without drafting see April 2019 Q 1iv-v, January 2020 Q 1b, c&d and Q 2g)**

1. Time within which the application is to be made (3 months or six months)
2. Manner of the exercise (notice usually in writing)
3. Condition precedent to be fulfilled before exercise of the option.
4. The terms of the new lease must be clearly stated.

**NOTE very importantly that** where the tenant/lessee does not exercise his option to renew, the option becomes a mere interest**.** The option to renew must be totally accepted by the tenant, if not the option to renew is terminated. (The tenant/lessee cannot ask for review nor vary it in any way; (**see January 2020 Q 1b)**

Secondly, in drafting the clause, it must exempt the rent clause and the option to renew from the terms that are constant; this is to prevent the creation of perpetual renewal of the lease.

**SAMPLE DRAFT January 2020 Q 1d, Dec 2020 Q 4d**

“The Lessor shall on the written request of the Lessee made at least three months before the expiration of the current term, grant to the Lessee the lease of the demised premises for another term of five years from the expiration of the current term on the same terms and conditions as the present lease, (except rent and this option to renew); Provided, however, that Lessee shall have materially observed all its obligations under the present lease”**.**

1. **ABATEMENT OF RENT CLAUSE-**

This is a clause that is meant to preserve the rent paid by a lessee during any period where he could not make use of the premises as a result of any natural occurrence. It must be specifically provided for, because generally frustration is inapplicable in leases.

**Sample Draft:**

‘The Lessor covenants with the Lessee that the rent shall not continue to run in a case of an act of God where the demised premises is destroyed or anything happens preventing the use of the premises**’**

1. **RENT REVIEW CLAUSE**

A rent review clause must be expressly provided for in a lease for the following reasons:

1. To keep up with or reflect the current market value of the property.
2. to cushion the effect of inflation and keep to the money value realisable from the demised premises.

In the absence of such clause, the vendor cannot increase the rent unilaterally**.**

**A rent-review clause should contain the following (August 2018 Q 1vi):**

1. Method of initiating the review.
2. The time frame for the review.
3. The method of calculating the new rent.
4. Procedure for resolving any dispute of the new rent.

The rent review clause can be drafted in two ways:

- 1. By inserting it in the reddendum or;
  2. The reddendum could refer to it in the schedule.

**Example of a rent review clause (can be included with the consideration clause):**

**“The rent reserved in this lease shall be reviewed** within three (3) months of the expiry of the current rent; the lessee shall by notice in writing be notified of a review of the rent. The amount of the reviewed rent is to be fixed by an estate valuer appointed by the parties. In the event of any disputes arising from the rent review procedure, a single arbitrator shall be appointed by the parties subject to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act”

**DETERMINATION OF A LEASE OR TENANCY (Bar Final April 2019 Q 1bvi)**

The following are the various methods in which a lease may be determined or brought to an end;

1. **Effluxion of Time:** This is where the lease if for a fixed period which has elapsed.
2. **Merger –**This is where the tenant or third party retains the lease and acquires the reversion before expiration of the lease.
3. **Notice to Quit**.
4. **By Surrender-**This is where the lessee voluntarily gives up the premises before the agreed date of determination**.**
5. **Disclaimer-**where a lessee sets up an adverse claim to the ownership of the property or claims direct ownership, the lessor is entitled to determine the lease.
6. **Frustration**\-This may arise as a result of war or natural disaster which makes the demised premises inhabitable; **_Araka v. Monier Construction Nig. Ltd._**

**NB-**Where the property is **destroyed** and the lessee remains in possession, he cannot plead frustration-**_Odusanya v. Oniororo_.**

1. **Forfeiture and Re-Entry:** This is where the lessee is meant to forfeit any term remaining in the lease and the lessor to retake possession of the premises. **Conditions for Forfeiture**
2. Express provision in the lease document
3. Rent must be reserved
4. Landlord must make a formal demand and tenant remains in default.

**Particulars of Instruction/Information Needed To Prepare A Lease (April 2018 Q 4d)**

1. Particulars of the parties, such as: name, address, occupation
2. Commencement date
3. The property being demised, its detailed description and whether only parts of the premises are being demised
4. Duration of the lease
5. Rent payable and method of payment; whether in advance or arrears
6. Covenants to be performed by the Lessee/Sub-Lessee
7. Covenants to be performed by the lessor/Sub-Lessor
8. Party to insure the property, duties and liabilities in respect of the insurance policy
9. Instructions on rent review (if desired), renewal of the lease, forfeiture and re-entry
10. Whether necessary consent has been obtained from Governor (sublease/Certificate of Occupancy)
11. Witnesses to attest the agreement

**CHAPTER SEVEN**

**MORTGAGES I, II & III**

Mortgage is a security transaction wherein an owner of a property transfers the interest in the property to another person for a loan with an agreement that the property will be transferred back to owner upon repayment of the loan.

**TRIPARTITE MORTGAGE**

This will arise where the mortgaged property belongs to a third party. Simply put, the person taking the loan is different from the person whose property is used to secure the loan. The third party will be known as a guarantor or surety.

**FEATURES OF A MOTGAGE**

- 1. It is a conveyance of an interest in land to a lender of money
  2. The land is held only as security or collateral to ensure repayment of the money loaned.
  3. The property is re-conveyed back to its owner when the money loaned is repaid.
  4. In the event of failure to repay the money advanced, the lender of the money has the right to sell the land to realise the money advanced.
  5. An essential feature of mortgage, both legal and equitable is that once a mortgage, always a mortgage and nothing but a mortgage; **_Yaro v. Arewa Construction Ltd_.**

**CONTRACT SUBJECT TO MORTGAGE**

A contract of sale of land entered into in expectation of some loan should be made conditional upon your client (purchaser/borrower) obtaining the loan. The contract should also provide that in the event that the loan is not obtained, the vendor shall return the deposit paid by the purchaser; this is what is referred to as contract subject to a mortgage. **For this clause to be valid the following conditions must exist:**

1. It must state the source and amount of the loan.
2. The terms of payment; and
3. The interest paid on the loan.

**MORTGAGE INSTITUTIONS IN NIGERIA (sometimes they may ask you to list a certain number of mortgage institutions)**

- - - 1. **Federal Mortgage Bank**

It is a Federal Government agency and it is the most Preferred Mortgage Institution for the following reasons;

1. The credit facility granted is long term (up to 25 to 30 years repayment)
2. Provides up to 66% of the consideration
3. The interest rate is very low, as low as 6%
4. Has branches across the federation, but this exists, to a large extent, in theory
5. Enjoys government support

- - - 1. **Housing Corporations**

**Advantages of this source of Mortgage Finance**

1. There is security of title in respect of property purchased from any of these corporations as there is no problem of demolition.
2. Funds from the corporation attract low rate of interest.
3. They are built on State land with their Certificate of Occupancy ready for collection;

**Disadvantages**

1. Prices are beyond the reach of ordinary Nigerians.
2. There is scarcity of funds, particularly for housing projects.
   - - 1. **Housing Schemes:** This is usually set up by employers to help its employees to own houses at a subsidized rate**.** Interest rate is low. It is on a long-term repayment plan. In other words, affordable deductions are made from the employee’s remunerations for several years.
3. **Commercial Banks**

**It is generally the least favourite because of the following reasons:**

1. Interest rate is usually very high.
2. Their loan may be short-term
3. Stringent collateral conditions
4. **Private Property Developers**
5. **Life Endowment**

This is a policy of life insurance and is a form of savings.

Insurance companies may lend or guarantee loan from a bank with a collateral mortgage of life policy. The borrower assigns the policy to the lender and the notice of this is given to the insurance company.

**CREATION OF MORTGAGES (Bar Final Favourite)**

There are, at common law, two broad types of mortgages, namely, **LEGAL** and **EQUITABLE**.

- 1. **LEGAL MORTGAGE**

Legal mortgage is any mortgage created in accordance with the law in which case, the mortgage is by deed and was duly perfected.

**Modes of Creation of Legal Mortgage (August 2018 Q 1viii & Q 2e, April 2019 Q 2c(b), August 2019 Q 4a, January 2020 Q 3a)**

Generally, the location of the property to be used as security and the applicable law determines the mode of creation of mortgage. It is therefore important for every student to know from the scenario where the property to be used as security is located.

The country is divided into three jurisdictions, namely:

**CONVEYANCING ACT (EAST & NORTH):**

we have three (3) methods/modes of creating a legal mortgage. It includes;

1. By Assignment
2. By Sub-demise
3. Charge by deed expressed to be by way of Statutory Mortgage

**BY ASSIGNMENT**

One major feature of this is that the mortgagor transfers the entire unexpired residue of his leasehold interest to the mortgagee.

There is no reversionary interest in the mortgagor, hence in the event of default; the mortgagee can pass the mortgagor’s entire interest to a purchaser without any problems.

There is no privity of contract between the Governor/Head-lessor and the mortgagee, there is privity of estate.

**Creating mortgage by Assignment is the preferred option for the mortgagee for the following reasons:**

1. The totality of the interest in the property is assigned to the mortgagee.
2. The mortgagee can exercise his right of sale easily without recourse to the mortgagor if the latter defaults: thus he can transfer the interest assigned to him to a subsequent purchaser
3. The title deeds are retained by the mortgagee.
   1. **SUB-DEMISE**

**The main advantages of this mode are:**

1. There is neither privity of contract nor privity of estate between the Governor/head-lessor and the mortgagee;
2. There is uniformity, as this mode is applicable under the CA as well as under the PCL states
3. It can be used to create successive legal mortgage in the PCL States only.

**The main disadvantage of creating mortgage by Sub-demise is that:**

- - - 1. The mortgagee cannot sell the mortgaged property together with the mortgagor’s reversion (i.e. the mortgagor must agree to sell the property). The only remedy to the above problem is either to use Power of Attorney and appoint the mortgagor as the donee or make a Trust Declaration and appoint the donee as trustee; **_Re White Rose Trust_**

**NOTE:** That under the PCL there is no need for the above clauses to cure the disadvantage of a mortgage by sub-demise as that has been taken care of by **section 112(1) of the PCL.**

- - - 1. In the **CA States,** the mortgagor cannot create successive legal mortgage.

    1. **Charge by deed expressed to be by way of STATUTORY MORTGAGE-S. 26(1) CA**
    2. **PROPERTY & CONVEYANCING LAW (PCL) STATES**

**This law applies to only six states to wit;** Ondo, Osun, Oyo, Ogun, Edo, Ekiti and Delta State.

Under the PCL, mortgage can be created generally by:

1. sub-demise,
2. legal charge and
3. by statutory mortgage;
4. **SUB DEMISE–Section 109 PCL;**

The same rules as explained earlier apply here, except that under the PCL, there is no need for the drafting devices. The law already makes provisions for them. **See section 112, PCL (a statutory power of sale for the mortgagee where the mortgagor defaults).** Allows subsequent and second mortgage to be created: **section 163 PCL**

1. **CHARGE BY DEED EXPRESSED TO BE BY WAY OF LEGAL MORTGAGE** –**S.110 PCL (This can simply be called Legal Charge)**

**Advantages of Creating Mortgage by Legal Charge (this is the preferred option)**

1. Since no interest is passed to the mortgagee, it is no breach of the covenant against sub-letting. **Section 22, Land Use Act**
2. It is shorter and simpler to create. **_Samuel v. Jarrah_**
3. It is easily discharged by a statutory receipt.
4. There is no transfer of the legal interest in the land/property used as security
5. It is convenient for mortgaging mixed properties i.e. A single charge could be used to cover multiple properties
6. The chargee has all the rights, powers and protection of a Legal mortgagee
7. It is best for creating successive legal mortgages without drafting a new Deed
8. **BY DEED OF STATUTORY MORTGAGE**

**Distinction between Legal Mortgage Created By Assignment under C.A and Legal Mortgage Created By Sub-Demise under PCL**

Banks prefer legal mortgage by sub-demise for two reasons:

- - - 1. **Lack of Privity --**In a legal mortgage created by an **Assignment**, even though there is no privity of contract, there is privity of estate, binding the mortgagee with liability for restrictive covenants running with the land; **_Tulk v. Moxhay_.** This opens the mortgagee (BANK) to liability for breach of the covenants.

On the other hand, **in** a mortgage by **sub-demise, t**here is neither privity of contract nor privity of estate between the Governor/head-lessor and the mortgagee, so the mortgagee will not be liable for any breach of covenant.

- - - 1. **Uniformity: mortgage by Sub-demise** is common both under the CA as well as under the PCL; hence there is uniformity, which is attractive to the Banks that have branches all over Nigeria. But assignment is only peculiar to CA states. 2. **Creation of successive legal mortgages using the same** property as security is not possible in CA states but only possible in PCL states for mortgages created by legal charge or sub-demise**\-section 109(2) PCL**

**NOTE the following:**

- In the CA States, the problem of reversionary interest over a mortgage created by sub-demise can be taken care of **by inserting the** **following in the mortgage deed**:

1. **POWER OF ATTORNEY CLAUSE:** By a **power of attorney** clause in the mortgaged deed, the mortgagee, in consideration of the mortgage sum is appointed attorney with authority to deal with the entire estate and including the reversionary interest. The power of attorney is expressed to be **irrevocable** until the loan is discharged and by this device, the mortgagee can sell the legal estate by virtue of the clause.
2. **TRUST DECLARATION:** the mortgage may provide for a **trust declaration**. The Mortgagor will be made to declare himself a trustee of the property in favour of the mortgagee and he would convey the property to the mortgagee as a beneficiary; see **_Re: White Rose Trust_**_._

**CREATION OF LEGAL MORTGAGE IN LAGOS STATE**

In Lagos State the applicable law in creation of mortgage is the **Mortgage and Property Law of Lagos State (MPL).**

Under the MPL, the mode of creation of legal mortgage depends on the nature of the mortgagor’s interest over the security as follows:

- - - 1. **Right of Occupancy:**

If the mortgagor is a holder of a Right of Occupancy, which means he is traditional or customary owner of the property before the Land Use Act: legal mortgage will be created by: Section 15 MPL

1. Demise for a term of years absolute
2. Charge by deed by way of legal mortgage
3. Charge by deed by way of Statutory mortgage

All in **Form No.1 to the 2 `<sup>`nd `</sup>` schedule MPL, S.4 MPL**

- - - 1. **Leasehold Interest:**

The title of the mortgagor is said to be leasehold if he is a holder of Certificate of Occupancy issued by the governor. Where the mortgagor’s interest is covered by a C of O, legal mortgage will be created by:

1. Sub-demise (less by at least one day)
2. Charge by deed by way of legal mortgage
3. Charge by deed by way of Statutory mortgage

**NOTE:** in the exam if the nature of the interest or title of the mortgagor is not indicated, students are expected to present the two above

**ADVANTAGES OF LEGAL MORTGAGE**

1. More Secured against fraud than equitable mortgage
2. Easier to enforce than equitable mortgage
3. Rank higher in priority than equitable mortgage
4. The mortgagee is entitled to the title document
5. Can be used for small, medium and large loans

**CREATION OF SUCCESSIVE LEGAL MORTGAGES USING THE SAME PROPERTY AS SECURITY**

This occur when the same property is mortgaged twice or more with different mortgagees.

- - 1. **In CA (East & North):** successive legal mortgages cannot be created over the same property.

This is because **in the CA States**, the applicable law for the creation of legal mortgage is the common law. This is because once a legal mortgage is created, the mortgagor transfers his legal title in the property to the mortgagee and what he has left is mere equity of redemption and therefore can only create an equitable mortgage.

- - 1. **In the PCL States:** successive legal mortgages **can** be created over the same property.

This is because under the **PCL**, where the mortgagor creates a legal mortgage by sub-demise, he retains his legal/reversionary interest, which he may subsequently mortgage to a second mortgagee by executing another legal mortgage.

**Conditions for Creation of Successive Legal Mortgages under the PCL**

1. The legal mortgage must have been created by sub-demise **OR** legal charge by deed expressed to be by way of legal mortgage.
2. The term to be taken by a subsequent mortgagee shall be at least one day longer than the term vested in the first mortgagee. (This is so that the first mortgage can become due before the subsequent mortgage)
3. The entire interest must not be exhausted. **section 109 (2) PCL**

**CREATION OF EQUITABLE MORTGAGE**

An equitable mortgage is a type of mortgage created under the rules of equity. It confers equitable interest on the mortgagee. It is a mortgage that can only be enforceable in equity.

**Modes of Creating Equitable Mortgages-(April 2018 Q2d, April 2019 Q 3a)**: The modes of creating equitable mortgages in Nigeria are uniform. There are five modes of creating equitable mortgages in Nigeria:

**Deposit of Title Deed with an intention to create a mortgage.**

This will arise where the mortgagor deposits his title documents with the mortgagee and collects a loan without any formal agreement. There must be a clear intention that the deed should be taken or retained as security for a loan.- **_Walsh v. Lonsdale; Russel v. Russel_.**

**An agreement to create or execute a legal mortgage at a later date.**

The equitable mortgagee can enforce the agreement by an action in equity for specific performance, on the principle in **_Walsh v. Lonsdale_**_;_ **_Yaro v. Arewa Construction Ltd; Ogundaini v. Araba_**

**Creation of an** **incomplete legal mortgage:** This may arise where any of the legal requirements or procedure for creation of legal mortgage was not observed for example, where the parties fails to obtain the governor’s consent; **section 22 Land Use Act; _Savannah Bank v Ajilo_.**

In such circumstance, the mortgage though not valid as a legal mortgage; will be enforced as an equitable mortgage.

- - - 1. **Creation of Mortgage over an equitable interest:** Where the interest of the mortgagor over the security is equitable, he can only create an equitable mortgage.
- - - 1. Equitable Charge of the Mortgagor’s Property**–_Ogundaini v. Araba_**

**Creation of Equitable Mortgage under the MPL Lagos State**

- - - 1. Deposit of title documents accompanied with an agreement to create a legal mortgage in favour of the mortgagee 2. By assignment of an equitable interest in favour of mortgagee: **section 18 of MPL**

**COVENANTS IN MORTGAGES (April 2019 Q 2c)**

**Covenant To Repay The Principal And Interest At A Fixed Date**

One of the basic features of mortgage is that the loan is repayable on an agreed date with interest**.** This covenant aids the mortgagee to know when his power of sale may arise.

**NOTE**: This covenant to repay principal & interest must be drafted as a positive inducement and not a negative inducement or as a punishment.

**EXAMPLE 1**

The courts will frown at a covenant drafted thus: **(January 2020 Q 3e)**

**“The interest payable is 15% but where mortgagor fails to pay on time, the interest shall be 20%”.**

Therefore, a better clause would go thus:

**“The interest payable on this loan is 20% but where the mortgagor pays promptly, it will be reduced to 15%**” (this is the one you should draft if asked for in the exam)

**COVENANT TO INSURE THE SECURITY**

This covenant is to provide for what would happen in the event of any damages or destruction to the property.

This is very important as the transaction is dependent on the mortgage property. Any damage or destruction to the property would adversely affect the rights of the parties. The mortgagee must therefore ensure that the property is insured.

**Contents of the Insurance Covenant (April 2019 Q 2c)**

The covenant should contain the following things: WRACA

1. Who to insure;
2. The risk to be insured against
3. The Insurance company
4. The amount of the Insurance Cover
5. Use of the insurance money.

**Factors that determines the risk to be insured against are: (Exam)**

- 1. The use to which the property is put
  2. The location of the property: flooded area, erosion prone
  3. The nature of the property itself – developed property or vacant land
     - 1. **COVENANT TO CONSOLIDATE DIFFERENT MORTGAGES**

Consolidation of mortgages occurs where a mortgagor uses different properties to secure a loan of money from the same mortgagee. (E.g. mortgage on property A for a sum of money from Zenith Bank, mortgage on property B for a sum of money from Zenith Bank and mortgage on property C for a sum of money from Zenith Bank); Zenith Bank may consolidate the mortgages into one and therefore the mortgagor must redeem all three properties at the same time and not separately.

Generally, the law prohibits consolidation of mortgages (because it is oppressive to the mortgagor) EXCEPT where the parties expressly agreed to it in their deed of mortgage; **S. 17 CA, s. 28 MPL, s. 115 PCL**.

**Conditions for Consolidation (April 2017 Q 3a)**

**a.** It must be the same mortgagor and mortgagee

b. The mortgage must be by deed

c. The legal due date for all the mortgages must have passed

d. It must have been expressly agreed by the parties and stated in the deed of mortgage.

- - - 1. **COVENANT TO REPAIR**

This deals with the reinstatement of parts that have fallen into disrepairs.

The aim is to maintain the value of the property to avoid depreciation of the property. The parties should agree on who is to repair, and list out the places to be repaired.

**NOTE**\-It is **advisable** that the mortgagee carried out the repairs and subsequently charges the cost of repairs on the mortgage property. However, repair does not include rebuilding the property: **_Nigerian Loan & Mortgage Co. v Ajetunmobi_.**

- - - 1. **COVENANT TO CREATE LEASE AND SUB-LEASE ON THE PROPERTY**

This largely depends on whether the lease was created before or after the mortgage. If there was a lease on the property before the mortgage the lease will be binding on the mortgagee and even on subsequent purchaser and the mortgagee will not be entitled to rent.

Where the lease is created **after** the mortgage, then the determining factor is whether either party is in possession in which case the party in possession of the mortgaged property can create a lease binding on the other**: Section 18(1) CA, section 121(1) PCL.**

- - - 1. **COVENANT NOT TO REDEEM FOR A FIXED TERM**

This covenant is aimed at ensuring that the mortgagor does not redeem the property immediately. The mortgagee may push for the insertion of these clauses in the agreement in order to enjoy the interest, which will accrue on the principal sum where the mortgagor

This is a negation of the right of the mortgagor to redeem his property at any time he is ready with the principal sum and interest already accrued. Thus, the courts frown at this restriction and therefore adopt a restrictive approach in interpretation and enforcement of this covenant.

However, it may be allowed upon the following being considered:

**A. What is the length of time?**

Where the length of time is short, the court may allow it. Where it is fairly long the court may not allow it.

**B. Who are the parties?**

If the mortgagor is a corporate body, not in liquidation, or those who are elites and knowledgeable, the court will allow the restriction on the ground that the members ought to know the implications of such restriction.

**C. What type of mortgage is created?**

If it is a legal mortgage with all the covenants agreed, the Court of equity will be slow to go against the agreement. If it is equitable mortgage, the court of equity is more willing to be sympathetic.

**PARTICULARS NEEDED TO PREPARE A MORTGAGE DEED**

1. Particulars of the parties: Full names and addresses
2. Date of commencement
3. Duration of the mortgage
4. Principal sum
5. Interest rate
6. Description of the mortgage property
7. Value of the property
8. The various covenants
9. Execution
10. The witnesses

**UP-STAMPING (see April 2018 Q 2a & August 2019 Q 3a, January 2020 Q 3c)**

This exists where a mortgagor had earlier borrowed money from a mortgagee using a particular property as security for a loan and subsequently the mortgagor wants additional loan from the same mortgagee using the same property as security. What is required in this instance is that the mortgagee should draft a new agreement and the document will be up-stamped. The security must be able to cover both loans

Simply put, up-stamping is the act of paying additional stamp duty on the new mortgage or loan agreement; a fresh governor’s consent is not required `<sup>`[\[1\]](#footnote-1) `</sup>`; **_Owoniboys Technical Services Ltd. v. Union Bank of Nigeria_**

The conditions for the grant of additional loan by a bank to an existing mortgagor relying on the same security are:

- 1. the security provided by the mortgagor can conveniently take care of the loan and interest.
  2. there would be proper up-stamping of the additional after it is granted
  3. re-registration of the mortgage instrument after up-stamping.

**Features of Up-Stamping**

1. The property is the same
2. The parties are the same
3. The new facility is different i.e. additional loan was granted.
4. Additional stamp duties in the new facility

**THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF A LEGAL MORTGAGEE (April 2018 Q 2c & August 2019 Q 3a, Dec 2020 Q 3c)**

A mortgagee has the following rights, powers or remedies upon default by the mortgagor:

1. Right of action to recover the mortgage sum and interest in Court
2. Right to sale of the mortgaged property
3. Action for foreclosure
4. Right of appointment of receiver
5. Right to take possession of the property
6. Right to sue for an order of specific performance.
   - - 1. **RIGHT TO TAKE POSSESSION**

Possession goes with legal estate. A **legal mortgagee** has a right to take possession of the mortgaged property upon execution of the mortgage … This right is **immediate**. An equitable mortgagee can only take possession of the property (security) upon a court order.

**When Should a Mortgagee Take Possession?**

1. Where the property is being squandered
2. Fear of destruction or depreciation is imminent
3. Where there is need to intercept the profit

**Reasons Why It Is Not Advisable To Take Possession: (April 2017 Q 3)**

1. The bank will be liable to account for the profits made or received on the property.
2. The Bank will be liable for negligence or wilful default for any sum not recovered.
3. The Bank is also liable for any deterioration or neglect or disrepair of the property. Thus must carry out repairs on the property.
4. The mortgagee cannot make profit from the property; he can only realise his security.
5. The mortgagee will also be deemed to have accepted payment by instalment.
   - - 1. **APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER**

A receiver is **an independent, uninterested third party** appointed to manage the mortgaged property: **_Adetona_** **_& Anor v. Zenith International Bank Ltd_**

**Powers, Duties and Rights of a Receiver: see Section 24 CA, Section 131 PCL**

1. The receiver shall have the power to demand and recover all the income of the property of which he is appointed receiver. Pursue debts owed to the property, collect any rents etc.
2. He shall be entitled to remuneration out of the money received by him to pay taxes, rates and other outgoings in respect of the property.
3. To pay interest accruing in respect of any principal money due under mortgage
4. To pay the residue of the money received by him to the person who is entitled to receive the income of the mortgaged property; **_Awojugbabe Light Industries v. Chinukwe_**
   - - 1. **ACTION IN COURT TO RECOVER PRINCIPAL SUM AND INTEREST**

The mortgagee can institute an action in court against the mortgagor to claim the principal sum advanced to the mortgagee and the interest that has accrued on it. This remedy is also available for an equitable mortgagee.

- - - 1. **ACTION FOR ORDER OF SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE**

This remedy is available to an **EQUITABLE MORTGAGEE.** This would arise where the equitable mortgagor **fails, refuses or neglects** to complete documentation of the mortgage agreement.

- - - 1. **POWER OF SALE (Dec 2020 Q 3d)**

The power and right of a mortgagee to sell property is central to legal mortgages created by deed. **It is automatic. T**he mortgagee need not go to court to enforce it**.** However, for the mortgagee to be entitled to exercise its power of sale, the power must **HAVE ARISEN** and **become EXERCISABLE. (2 conditions)**

For the power of sale to **ARISE** the following three conditions **MUST EXIST:**

1. The mortgage must have been created by a deed;
2. There must be no contrary intention against sale in the mortgage deed; and
3. The legal due date, which is the date of redemption/repayment of the mortgage must have passed: **Section 19(1) CA, section 123 PCL*, NHDS Ltd. v. Mummuni***

Even where power of sale has arisen, the mortgagee is still **NOT** entitled to sell the mortgaged property unless and until the power has become exercisable: **_NAB Ltd v. UBA PLC_.**

**The power becomes EXERCISABLE when any of the three conditions in section 20 CA and 125 PCL** is satisfied, which is that:

1. Default of payment of the principal sum of which a written Notice to the mortgagor to pay the loan sum had been served on him and after a period **of 3 months** he is still in default, or
2. The interest sum are in arrears (default) of which **2 months**’ notice has been served and the mortgagor still does not pay, or
3. There has been a breach of any covenant other than the covenant to pay the principal sum and interest in the mortgage deed or under the statute i.e. the CA or the PCL. See **_Okafor & Sons Ltd v NHDS Ltd_.**

**Protection of Innocent Purchaser**

A purchaser who purchases a mortgaged property **BEFORE** the power of sale arises will not acquire a good title. But where the power of sale has arisen but was yet to become exercisable when the mortgagee sold the property, the mortgagor may apply for the sell to be set aside.

However, **Section 21(2) CA and section 126(2) PCL** offers protection to a third party or purchaser who buys the property where the power has arisen but not become exercisable provided he is a **_bona fide_** purchaser for value without notice of the default; **(Dec 2020 Q 3d)**; **_Ihekwoaba v. ACB; Okonkwo v CCB; Eka-Eteh v. NHDS_**

**A sale of the property used as security may be set aside by the court on the following grounds:**

- 1. That the mortgagor has no good title _ab initio_
  2. There is fraud/collusion between the mortgagee and the purchaser; **_Okonkwo v CCB, ACB v Ihekwoba_**
  3. That the right of sale has not arisen when the property was sold.
  4. That the sale was made after payment of the out-standing mortgage sum.
  5. Where the property was sold for a gross undervalue.
  6. The mortgagee sold to itself or to its agent.

**A sale of the property used as security for a mortgage will not be set aside on the following grounds:**

- 1. It was sold at a low price, except it was sold at a gross undervalue and there is fraud in it: **S. 183 of the PCL and _Okonkwo v. CCB_**
  2. The outstanding sum is contested by the parties
  3. The sale was motivated by ill-will
  4. The mortgagor has paid a part of the loan
  5. The mortgage sum and interest is paid after the sale
  6. An Order of the Court was not obtained before the sale**\-_UBN Ltd. v. Olori Motors Ltd_**

**Application of Proceeds of Sale: (Bar Final 2017 & 2018, Dec 2020 Q 6e)**

**Proceeds of sale may be applied in the following order:**

1. Pay up all mortgages having priority.
2. Pay commission to the auctioneer and other costs of sale.
3. Pay up outstanding interests and the principal sum.
4. Pay balance to persons entitled to equity of redemption.

**Section 21(3) CA, section 127 PCL, _Visioni Ltd v. NBN_**

**NB:** Where the proceeds of sale do not satisfy the principal and the interest, the mortgagee can sue the mortgagor to recover the balance.

- - - 1. **ACTION FOR FORECLOSURE**

This is an Order of Court extinguishing the mortgagor’s equity of redemption. The Order is first made nisi (in the interim) and then it becomes absolute after 6 months so that the mortgagor can pay off his indebtedness within these 6 months**.** Within these 6 months, the mortgagee cannot exercise his other powers e.g. power of sale. It is the primary remedy of an equitable mortgagee: **_Ogundaini v Araba_**. Foreclosure is better where mortgagee is interested in the principal sum.

**The Order of foreclosure can be re-opened on the following grounds:**

- - 1. The mortgagee is still suing the mortgagor to repay the balance of the mortgage sum if the proceeds of sale is not enough to satisfy the loan 2. Fraud 3. That there are conditions beyond his control preventing him from paying the loan sum 4. The mortgagee acted mala fide in obtaining the order nisi 5. The property as security is of immense value i.e. it is a family property

**MORTGAGOR’S REMEDIES AND RIGHTS**

A mortgagor has the right to redeem his property at any time before the due date, on the due date and even after the due date. This is so because once a mortgage is always a mortgage; **_Yaro v Arewa Construction Company Ltd_**. This is known as equity of redemption**.**

The right of the mortgagor to redeem can never be clogged upon either expressly or impliedly by agreement in the mortgage Deed- **_Santley v Wilde; Fair-clough v Swan Breweries Co. Ltd_.**

The right of the mortgagor to redeem the mortgage on or before the legal due date for repayment of the loan is known as **Legal Right to Redeem**.

While the right to redeem after the due date is the right granted by equity to the mortgagor to still recover his security by paying the mortgage sum and interest although the time fixed for the payment of the money has passed. This is known as **Equitable Right to Redeem.**

**NOTE:** the equitable right to redeem becomes extinguished where the mortgagee has exercised its power of sale or has obtained an order of foreclosure which has become absolute.

**PERFECTION OF LEGAL MORTGAGE**

- - - 1. **GOVERNOR’S CONSENT; Section 22 LUA**

The consent of the Governor must be sought and obtained for the creation of a legal mortgage. Failure to obtain the consent of the **Governor before actual mortgage** itself makes the transaction null and void; _see_ **_Savannah Bank v. Ajilo_–**The transaction is inchoate but not unenforceable**; _Awojugbabe Light Industries v Chinukwe_.**

**Documents Required for Governor’s Consent**

1. Application letter for Governor’s consent/or a written application made to that effect, depending on State practice
2. The title documents e.g. right of occupancy, certificate of occupancy, title deeds
3. A copy of the duly executed deed of legal mortgage/deed
4. Tax clearance certificates of the mortgagor for the preceding three years and that of the guarantor (if any)
5. Receipts of payment of ground rent, consent fee, inspection fee, tenement rate, and other charges imposed on the property.
6. Valuation report
7. Approved building plan of the property

**When mortgagor is a company: the following documents will be included:**

1. Copy of the Memorandum and Article of Association of the Company
2. Copy of Resolution of the Board of Directors authorising creation or mortgage on the company’s property
3. Copy of the certificate of incorporation of the company
   - - 1. **STAMPING**

A deed of legal mortgage is required to be stamped as evidence of payment of stamp duties (taxes) imposed by the Stamp Duties Act. The duty paid on mortgages is ad valorem (according to the value of the transaction). A document is required to be stamped **within 30 days** of its execution **section 23 Stamp Duties Act**.

- - - 1. **REGISTRATION**\-**Section 2(1) Land Instrument Registration Law:**

A deed is to be registered **within 60 days** of its execution

**Effect of Non Registration of Mortgage: (Exam Focus)**

a. The instrument is inadmissible in evidence (to prove title)**:** **section 15 Land Instrument Registration Law of Lagos (LIRL)**, **_Ogunbambi v. Abowoab_**. It is only admissible to prove payment of money.

b. An unregistered deed of mortgage **loses priority** where there is conflict of interest.-**_Fakoya v. St. Paul Church Shagamu;_ Section 16 LIRL*, Okoye v. Dumez***

c. If the property falls within the registration district and it is not registered **within two months** of the execution of the deed of mortgage, the transaction will be void**_: Idowu v. Onashile_**_;_ **_Onashile v. Barclays Bank Co._**

**DISCHARGE OF MORTGAGES (Bar Final)**

1\. **Legal mortgage (by way of sub-demise or assignment**) is discharged by Deed of Discharge, Deed of surrender or Deed of Release.

2\. Equitable mortgages are discharged by **receipt of payment of principal and interest under hand (need not be typed).**

3\. **Legal mortgage created by charge** under PCL states is discharged by way of statutory receipt.

4\. Where the mortgagor is a company, a memorandum of satisfaction at the CAC is to be executed in its favour upon re-payment of the sum. **Section 204 CAMA.**

**POSSIBLE EXAM QUESTIONS**

- - - 1. **Identifies or state the mode for creation of the mortgage over the property located in Asaba Delta State.**

**Answer:** Since Delta is a PCL state legal mortgage will be created by sub-demise, legal charge and by statutory mortgage; section 109-110 PCL (**NOTE: The property may be located in any other state**)

- - - 1. **Mention 4 covenants that must be in the mortgage deed.** 2. **State five remedies available to the bank upon default by the mortgagor in repaying the loan.** 3. **Assuming the mortgagor merely deposited his title documents with the bank, state the condition precedent for the bank to sell the property if the mortgagor defaults.**

**Answer**: if the mortgagor merely deposited his title documents then it is an equitable mortgage and therefore the mortgagee must obtain an order of court before it can sell the property.

- - - 1. **The mortgagor intends to borrow additional loan from the mortgagee using the same property as security, advise the parties of the legality or otherwise of doing so.**

**Answer:** It is possible. That is up-stamping where in the parties will pay additional stamp duties on the new loan granted.

- - - 1. **CONTINGENCY OR SUCCESS–BASED FEE**

This is fee charged after the success of the action. The solicitor agrees with the client on the amount he will be paid based on the amount they actually recover. Where no such amount is recovered, he may earn nothing. Under the common law, contingent fees are prohibited, whereas it is banned under **Rule 50(2) RPC** for criminal matters. It is only permitted in civil cases -**R. 50(1) RPC**

**WILLS AND CODICILS 1 & II**

This is one of the most important and frequent exam topics. It usually appears as a compulsory question and it can form a full question without an addition of any other topic. **(See April 2018 Q3, August 2018 Q4, April 2019 Q6, August 2019 Q1, January 2020 Q4 and December 2020 Q1).**

Some of the frequent areas will be highlighted in the course of the discussion of this topic.

**Reasons/Advantages of Making A Will (August 2019 No 1(a))**

- - 1. It excludes or limits the application of customary rules of inheritance. 2. A testator can appoint trusted persons to manage his estate. 3. A valid will confers authority on the executors to act immediately following the death of the testator. 4. It ensures positive display of wishes of the testator. 5. It is easier to obtain probate because a grant of letter of administration involves additional expenses of bonds and sureties. 6. It gives the Testator’s peace of mind and sense of fulfilment. 7. The testator gives special directives as to the disposition of his property. 8. The testator may give additional directives as to his burial. 9. It enables the testator to decide who should inherit any property in his estate.

**Reasons for the Undesirability In Making A Will**

A lot of people do not make Wills for the following reasons:

1. Ignorance.
2. Illiteracy and lack of exposure.
3. Superstitions.
4. Lack of trust.

**CAPACITY TO MAKE A WILL**

These are the elementary criteria to be possessed by an individual **before** he is qualified in law to make a valid Will. The testator must possess the **TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY** to make a Will. Testamentary capacity involves two main criteria; that is:

1. Age and
2. Mental capacity
   - - 1. **AGE OF THE TESTATOR**

Only Adults from **18 years** in Lagos State (**section 3 Wills Law, Lagos**) or **21 years of age** in States under the **Wills Act** **(section 7 Wills Act),** can make Wills.

The **EXCEPTION** to the above rule is a **privileged** Will allowed to be made by members of the Military who **are below the age limit of adulthood** as follows;

- 1. Soldiers in actual military service (at war)
  2. Sea Men at sea
  3. Mariners at sea
  4. Crew of commercial airlines in the Air; **S. 11 Wills Act; S. 6 Wills Law Lagos**

1. **MENTAL CAPACITY**

A testator must have the mental capacity or sound-disposing mind to make a Will. This must be present both at the time of giving instructions for his Will to be prepared and at the time of its execution. **_See Okelola v. Boyle_**

**Test of Testamentary Capacity**

The test for determining if the testator has mental capacity or a sound disposing mind when making his Will was laid down in the case of **_Banks v. Goodfellow_** as follows:

1. The testator understands the nature and effect of making a Will.
2. He recollects all the properties he wishes to dispose, i.e. he knows the extent of his estate; **_Johnson v Maja_**_;_ **_Adebajo v. Adebajo_**
3. He recollects and appreciates the persons who are the intended beneficiaries.
4. He remembers and clearly states the manner in which the estate is to be distributed between the beneficiaries.

**Onus of Proof of Mental Capacity**

If the **state of mind** of the testator is contested, the onus is on **the propounder** of the Will to establish that the Will was **duly executed** usually by showing that the Will is rational on its face or by advancing positive affirmative evidence in support that the testator was in a good state of mind; **_Johnson v Maja_**

**Proof of Sound Disposing Mind**

To prove the mental capacity of a testator, a legal practitioner may rely on:

1. Presumption of a sound disposing mind or
2. Positive affirmative evidence of a sound mind. This may be by showing;
   - 1. That the testator wrote the will himself;
     2. That there was attestation before witnesses;
     3. The conduct of testator before and after the will was made;
     4. Showing evidence of general habit in the course of life,
     5. Medical evidence

**Presumption of Sound Disposing Mind**

It is presumed that a testator was sane at the time he made his Will. The presumption of sound mind is based on the view that where a Will appears _ex-facie_ rational and logical, it will be presumed to be so; **_Okelola v. Boyle_**

This is based on the Latin maxim ‘**_omnia prae sumuntur rite esse acta’_** (which means ‘everything is presumed to be regular which appears regular’).

**Precautionary Measures By A Solicitor In Respect To Mental Capacity**

- 1. Prepare a confirmatory statement to be signed by the testator that he had mental capacity to make a Will. **_Re: Walker_**
  2. The Solicitor can also get a medical report by a medical practitioner who examined the testator confirming the presence of mental capacity of the testator.

**BLIND PERSONS CAPACITY TO MAKE A WILL**

A blind person can make a Will; however, for the Will to be valid, a special attestation clause must be inserted to the Will as evidence of having read the Will to him. It is called **blind person’s jurat.**

**NOTE**: A blind person cannot attest or act as a witness to a Will because his disability makes it impossible for him to see the signature of the testator and the act of signing the document.

**REQUIREMENTS FOR A VALID WILL**

- - - 1. **WRITING**

Every valid Will must be in writing. No particular form of writing is required; therefore it may be typed, printed or even handwritten.

The language must not only be English. It can be on any language; **_Whiting v. Turner_**; **S. 9 Wills Act,** **S. 4. Wills Law Lagos**

- - - 1. **SIGNED BY THE TESTATOR**

The Will must be signed by the testator. A signature may be an initial**,** a cross, rubber stamp,

**A testator may sign the Will in 3 ways, these includes: (Dec 2020 Q 1i)**

1. Signing the Will in the presence of at least 2 witnesses who must in his presence also attest to the Will.
2. The testator may appoint a third party to sign the Will and adopt it in the presence at least 2 other witnesses
3. The Testator himself may pre-sign the Will and later acknowledge same as his signature in the presence of at least 2 witnesses **S. 9 Wills Act; section 4 Wills Law Lagos**
   - - 1. **ATTESTATION BY THE WITNESSES(August 2019 Q 1b)**

The signature of the testator must be made or acknowledged by him in the presence of **at least** two witnesses who must be present at the same time**.**

The witnesses must be present at the same time when the testator is signing though they may not be present when **each** of them is signing**\-_Chodwick v Palmer_**

**NOTE**: A witness must sign **in his own hand** and cannot direct another to sign on his behalf as a witness.

**Beneficiaries or their Spouses Attesting A Will (August 2014 Q 1hii)**

The general rule is that a beneficiary to a Will and his/her spouse cannot take the gift made to them under a Will if either of them is a witness to the Will. Any gift made to such person will be utterly null and void**; S. 15 Wills Act; S. 8 Wills Law Lagos.**

**Exceptions to the Above Rule are:**

- 1. Where a witness had signed the Will before marrying a beneficiary under the Will.
  2. There are more than 2 witnesses who attested to the Will and one of them benefited from the Will.
  3. The gift was made to the witness in settlement of a debt.
  4. Where the witness holds the gift as a trustee under the will.
  5. The gift was subsequently confirmed in another Will or codicil, which is not attested to by the beneficiary.
  6. The witness is subsequently appointed a Solicitor to the Will which contained a charging clause.

**VITIATING ELEMENTS OF A VALID WILL**

The following can make a valid Will invalid;

1. Insane Delusion
2. Undue influence
3. Fraud
4. Mistake
5. Suspicious circumstances
6. **INSANE DELUSION**

Delusion is a belief which no rational person could hold but which reasoning with the testator cannot eradicate from his mind and which is capable of influencing the provision of his will.

The Delusion must influence disposition to render the will invalid-**_Battan-Singh v. Armichand;_** **_Amu v. Amu_**. There must be a nexus between the delusion and the disposition of the will.

**NOTE**: Where a testator gives instructions with sound disposing mind directly to a solicitor but before execution loses mental capacity, the will is still valid if executed with knowledge–**_Parker v. Felgate_**

1. **UNDUE INFLUENCE**

Undue influence is coercion to make a will in a particular way. **_Hall v. Hall_**

An undue influence must be proven not presumed. In the case of **_Money-Penny v Brown_**, the wife was holding the hand of the testator on his sick bed and was directing what he wrote, the Will was set aside for undue influence; see also **_Myn v Robinson._**

However, mere existence of fiduciary relationship or immoral consideration (for instance where the testator was living with his mistress until his death) does not imply undue influence: **_Johnson v Maja._**

**NOTE**: Influences which appeal to affections or sentiments of past gratitude for past services or pity for example where the wife of the testator said _“Remember all my sufferings with you all this years, they should not be in vain while you write your Will_**”,** cannot be regarded or treated as undue influence; **_Hall v Hall; Johnson v Maja_ (See August 2013 Q 6Aii)**

1. **SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE**

This is a situation where the circumstances surrounding the Will are such that casts doubt in the mind of the court to the effect that the Will may not constitute the free will of the testator. For instance where; the sole beneficiary is the solicitor or the neighbour of the testator**; _Wintle v Nye, Okelola v Boyle_**

**ALTERATION OF A WILL (August 2019 Q 1d &e)**

A Will is ambulatory in nature. This means that it may be altered from time to time during the lifetime of the testator.

Any alteration in a Will after its due execution will only be valid if after the alteration the Will was executed by the testator in the joint presence of at least 2 witnesses who will also attest to it in accordance with **section 9 of the Will Act**.

**CLASSES OF GIFTS UNDER A WILL (Exam August 2016 Q4, 2017 Q4, April 2018 Q3, April 2019 Q6, August 2019 Q1, January 2020 Q 4a, Dec 2020 Q 1c)**

This is a very important sub-topic for the purpose of your exams. Usually, a list of gifts is made in the scenario and the students will be asked to identify the nature and implication of such gift.

**Types of Legacy/Gifts in a Will**

1. **SPECIFIC LEGACY**

This is a gift of an identifiable property that is specific and distinguishable from the other properties owned by the testator. It is a gift that was particularly and clearly described.

**EXAMPLES:** “I give **My Toyota Camry car with Reg. No BQ232 AW to my daughter Bimpe”**.

**Implications/Features of Specific Legacy (Jan 2020 Q4b, Dec 2020 Q1c)**

It is not liable to **abatement**. This means that the issue of insufficient funds or the estate is not enough to satisfy all legacies, obligations or debts will not affect the gift.

It is however subject to **ademption**. This means that the gift may change in form or nature or even get lost. If the gift is no longer in existence or cannot be found at the time of the testator’s death, it would be said that the gift has adeemed.

1. **GENERAL LEGACY**

This is where the gift was made in general nature. There is no specific description of the gift. It does not refer to a particular piece of the testator’s estate. The testator intends that the gift should be satisfied from the general assets of his estate. **EXAMPLES**

**‘A gift of a Camry car to my son Joel**’;

If the testator does not own a Camry Car at his death, the Executors/Personal Representative will provide for it from the testator’s general estate.

**Legal implication/Features of General Legacy: (Jan 2020 Q 4b)**

General legacy is not liable to **ademption** but it suffers **abatement** where estate is insufficient.

1. **DEMONSTRATIVE LEGACY**

This may be in form of general legacy but directed to be satisfied from a specific fund or particular pool of property i.e. testator will demonstrate to the executors the source from which the gift is to come from

**EXAMPLE**

**‘I give 50,000 naira to Bimped to be drawn from my savings account No. 2345678910 at Diamond Bank Akay**’

Demonstrative gift is not subject to ademption and will only abate where the particular fund is not sufficient to take care of the legacy.

1. **PECUNIARY LEGACY**

This is strictly money dispositions. It could be specific or demonstrative or general. It may or may not give direction of the particular fund where the money should be drawn from, if it gives direction on the particular fund, it is demonstrative legacy.

**NOTE that Pecuniary** legacy is called an **ANNUITY** when it is expressed to be paid at intervals.

Example: **‘I give N50, 000 to my wife Nkechi to be paid to her every month**’.

1. **RESIDUARY LEGACY**

This is the remainder of the property belonging to the estate after payment of all other gifts and debts, expenses taxes and liability of the testator have been fulfilled, cleared or paid. It is made up of personal or real property.

A residuary clause is usually inserted in the Will to transfer all remaining residue and remainder of the estate to anyone the testator desires.

**Such remainder may have been derived from the following sources: (August 2016 Q 4c, April 2018 Q 3b, and Jan 2020 Q 4d, Dec 2020 Q 1a)**

1. Property acquired by testator after making his will or codicil
2. Properties acquired after testator’s death.
3. Gifts that lapsed by the death of the beneficiary or lack of substitution clause
4. Gifts that failed.
5. Gifts rejected or renounced by the beneficiaries

The beneficiaries are called **‘Residuary LEGATEES’**

**Example**: **“I give all the remainder of my properties not specifically given out in my Will to my children in equal share”**.

**NOTE THAT: the e**ffect of not including the residuary clause in the Will is that it will lead to **partial intestacy**. That means dividing up the part of estate according to the rules of intestacy. In which case the personal representatives of the testator will require Letters of Administration to be able to deal with the remainder of the estate; (**January 2020 Q 4c, Dec 2020 Q 1a)**

**ABATEMENT OF GIFTS**

This will arise where the estate of a testator is enough or sufficient to satisfy the legacies in the Will. This is possible where the testator was rich when he made the Will but became financially unstable before his death.

**ADEMPTION OF GIFTS**

This will arise where there has been a substantial change in the form or nature of the gift or that the gift or legacy was no longer in the existence as at the time of the testator’s death.

**The following will result to ademption: (Exam Focus)**

- - - 1. The property is destroyed as result of natural disasters/consequences like fire. 2. Where the testator sold the property during his lifetime or for any reason lost the interest/ownership of the property. 3. Where the government compulsorily acquires the interest in a gift of real/landed property during the life time of the testator.

**PLEASE NOTE CAREFULLY: (see August 2013 Q 6C, Jan 2020 Q 4e, Dec 2020 Q 1d & e)**

- If the government acquires a property given out in a Will during the lifetime of the testator, but paid compensation for the acquisition after the testator’s death, the money will go to the testator’s residuary estate and not to the beneficiary.
- But if the acquisition of the property by the government was made after the testator’s death, the gift will not adeem, therefore any compensation paid will go to the beneficiary.
- If the property was used by the testator to secure a loan which was not redeemed before the testator’s death, the property will still go to the beneficiary who will acquire the equity of redemption (i.e. the beneficiary may repay the loan and get back the property) unless the Bank has exercised its power of sale.

**FAILURE OF GIFTS**

These are situations where the legacies/bequests will not be available to the beneficiary under a Will for some reasons which may include:

- 1. Where a witness or the spouse not falling under the exceptions is a beneficiary under the Will: **S. 8 Wills Law and S. 15 of the Wills Act**
  2. The **specific** gift is caught by **ademption** where the gift is no longer in existence or that its nature/ character have changed before the testator’s death. In such a case the beneficiary will have nothing. The **solution** to this is to make provision for **alternative gift**.
  3. Based on **public** **policy** the gift will fail like when the beneficiary is **proved** to have **killed** the testator–**_Errignton v. Errington_ OR** to incite divorce or for an immoral purpose.
  4. The gift was made to promote an **illegal** purpose.
  5. The estate of the testator **abated** when it is insufficient to give any gift charged on it in a Will.
  6. **Conditional** gift made subject to fulfilling some **unsatisfied** conditions.
  7. Gifts contrary to the **_Nemo Dat Quod Non Habet_** rule-Where testator has no valid title **over the property.**

**LAPSE OF GIFT (April 2017 Q4 and August 2017 Q4c, Dec 2020 Q1h)**

A gift will lapse where the beneficiary dies before the testator. Where the beneficiary predeceases (or dies before) the testator, the gift lapses and falls into residuary estate of the testator because gifts in a will are expectancy (testamentary).

**Exceptions To Lapse of Gift**

Where a beneficiary dies before the testator, the gift will not lapse on any of the following circumstances:

- 1. Where it is a class gift(s) made to more than one person **JOINTLY** or in **EQUAL** shares. The other **survivors** will take the gift.
  2. Where the gift is made to settle a debt or moral obligations, it will not be affected by the doctrine of lapse whether or not the obligation is legally binding.
  3. Where there is a substitution or alternative gifts (**substituted beneficiary).**
  4. A gift to a testator’s child who dies in the life time of the testator but has a child who is living after the death of the testator will not lapse but go to the surviving child of the beneficiary; **S. 33 Wills Act, S. 24 Wills Law (April 2018 Q 3c)**
  5. **Presumption of Death**: Where two or more persons have died in circumstances in which it is uncertain who died first, they are presumed to have died in order of seniority. Therefore, if the Testator is older than the beneficiary and they die at the same time, it is presumed that the testator died first, thus the gift will not lapse; **(Dec 2020 Q 1h)**

**REVOCATION OF WILLS**

A Will may be revoked or made invalid either by the acts of the testator or by implication of the law. The various ways a Will may be revoked are:

1. **VOLUNTARY REVOCATION:** This may be through any of the following ways:
2. By the testator making a subsequent Will or Codicil duly executed
3. By a written declaration with the intention to revoke the will
4. By destruction of a Will with the requisite intention to make it invalid
5. **INVOLUNTARY REVOCATION (Revocation By Operation of Law)**

This may arise by the testator engaging in a subsequent statutory marriage (under the Marriage Act).

**VOLUNTARY REVOCATION**

A will may be voluntarily revoked in any of the following ways:

1. **Subsequent Will or Codicil:**

A will may be revoked by the testator making a subsequent Will or Codicil duly **executed** with a revocation clause stating that he revokes the earlier Will.

**NOTE importantly that:**

- Where the subsequent Will has no revocation clause but is in contrast with the provisions of the earlier Will, the new Will takes precedence.
- If the new Will covers practically the same grounds as the earlier one **or w**here the new Will disposed the same properties to either different beneficiaries or in a manner inconsistent with the former Will, the old Will is deemed revoked**_\-Hemphrey v. Hemphrey; Demsay v Lawson_ (August 2013 Q 6a)**

1. **Written Declaration with the Intention to Revoke the Will:**

The testator may revoke his Will through a written declaration. The written declaration must be duly executed for it to be valid. It must be written with intention to revoke the will (**_animus revocandi_**).

There must be absence of mistake, fraud or undue influence; **S. 9 Wills Act;** **S.4 Wills Law Lagos**; **_Parker v. Parker; Hemphrey v. Hemphrey_**

1. **Destruction of A Will with the Requisite Intention to Make It Invalid**:

A testator may simply destroy his Will. The destruction and the intention to revoke and the physical act of destruction must be contemporaneous. It must exist at the same time.

**Modes of Destruction: D**estruction may be in two (2) **ways** /**modes:**

1. Personal destruction by the testator with an intention to revoke same; or
2. By giving instructions to a third party to destroy the Will

**NOTE:** for destruction by a third party to be valid, the following conditions must exist: (**exams area**)

1. The instruction to destroy the Will must be in writing; **_Re Dadds_**
2. The testator must be present when it is been destroyed.
3. The destruction must be at his request or direction; **S. 20 Wills Act; S. 13 Wills Law**

**_Re Goods of Kreme_**: pursuant to phone instruction by client to solicitor, solicitor destroyed client’s Will. It was held invalid as the testator was not there when will was destroyed; **_Re Goods of Bacon_**

**Examples of insufficient acts of destruction:**

- - - - 1. Merely squeezing the Will 2. Drawing lines across the Will; **\_Cheese v. Lovejo_y** 3. Tearing some parts of the Will**; _Perkes v Perkes_**

**NOTE**: tearing part of the Will would only revoke the part torn off not the entire Will **UNLESS** an essential part is destroyed **or** where the destruction renders the remaining part meaningless, then then entire will is deemed revoked**; _Re_** **_Goods of Woodward_**

**INVOLUNTARY REVOCATION/REVOCATION BY OPERATION OF LAW**

A Will may be revoked involuntarily or by operation of law in any of the following ways:

**Subsequent Marriage under the Act**

The position of the law is that if a testator after making a Will contracts a valid marriage under the Act, the Will is impliedly revoked by that marriage; **s. 18 Wills Act**

**EXCEPTIONS to the Above Rule are as Follows: (Dec 2020 Q 1b)**

- 1. A Will was made in contemplation of marriage and the real marriage took place with the same person contemplated in the Will; **_Scallis v. Jones_; S. 11 Wills Law**
  2. The testator was married under **Customary** **Law** and later got married under the Act with the same person. **_Jadesimi v. Okotie-Eboh_; S.11 Lagos Wills Law**
  3. If the subsequent marriage is void, it cannot revoke a valid Will.
  4. A subsequent marriage **under native law and custom** does not revoke an earlier Will.

**Making of a Subsequent Will without a Revocation Clause**

Where a testator makes a Will and subsequently makes a new Will without a revocation clause, the new will shall be deemed to have impliedly revoked the old Will if it contains the same dispositions in a contrary manner. For instance, it contains the same properties but was given to different beneficiaries in the new Will.

**REPUBLICATION OF A WILL**

Republication of a Will is the confirmation or reaffirmation of the validity and contents of a Will. This is done by re-execution or by a codicil. Republication confirms a Will, which has been lying dormant and is unrevoked. Republication changes the date the will takes effect which will be the date of republication not the date on the original will.

**REVIVAL OF A WILL**

This is to bring into existence a revoked Will. This may be done by either a Will or Codicil. This is the act of bringing back to life or operation a revoked Will or codicil so long as it is not destroyed. Date of revival is effective date.

**CODICILS**

For there to be a codicil, there must be an earlier Will. All the formalities for a Will to be valid apply to a codicil. Therefore the testator must possess the testamentary capacity as at the time of making the Codicil and the codicil must be executed by the testator in the presence of two witnesses who must be present at the same time and who shall attest to the codicil **section 9 Wills Act.**

**Functions/Uses of a Codicil (August 2013 Q 6c, August 2019 Q 1e)**

A codicil performs the following functions:

1. It may affirm the contents of a Will.
2. It may alter or amend the provisions of a Will.
3. It may correct a clerical error in a Will.
4. It may revoke, revive and republish a Will.

**When to Advise a Client to Execute a Fresh Will**

1. When there is a new or subsequent marriage
2. When there is excess alteration or mutilation of the original will
3. When there is change in finances and assets.

**LIMITATIONS TO TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY/FREEDOM**

The general rule is that a person has the testamentary freedom to devise his property as he wishes: **_Banks v Goodfellow_**, **_Adesubokun v. Yunusa_.**

**The Exceptions to the Above Rule are as Follows:**

- - 1. **Islamic Law Restrictions**

It is a rule that a person subject to Islamic Law immediately after his death can only dispose **1/3** (one-third) of his properties by Will. The remaining 2/3 (two-third) must be disposed in accordance with the Islamic Law of disposing same. This is applicable to some States Wills Law; **_Ajibaye v. Ajibaye_** (where the Kwara State Wills Law was applied).

**NOTE** that for this restriction to apply, the testator must be a Muslim and must have lived and died in a place where the Islamic Law restriction is recognized. **(See August 2017 Q 4c)**

- - 1. **Customary Law Restriction**

Under Customary Law, a testator cannot dispose by Will any property which the testator had no power to dispose of by Will or otherwise under customary law to which he was subject. **S. 1 Wills Law Lagos State, _Idehen v. Idehen_, _Lawal-Osula v. Lawal-Osula._**

**For example** in Benin, Edo State a particular customary law practice prohibits the transfer of the ancestral house called ‘**_igiogbe_**_’_ to any other person other than the first son.

**NOTE**: It does not matter that the first was an illegitimate child or born out of wedlock provided that the testator acknowledged his parenthood and the child performed all the burial rights.

Therefore, any declaration in a Will purporting to exclude this customary practice will be void; **(see August 2019 Q1d, Jan 2020 Q4f & g)**

- 1. **PROVISIONS TO DEPENDANTS**

The testator is required by some Laws to make reasonable financial provisions to his dependents (wife, husband and children). His failure to do so, the dependents can apply to Court within 6 months of the admitting will to probate to vary the will: **S. 2 Wills Law of Lagos State.**

**INSTRUCTIONS NEEDED TO DRAFT A WILL–(August 2013 Q 6c, 2016 Q 4f, 2017 Q 4a)**

- 1. The full names/ nick names and address of the testator
  2. Names and addresses of the executors of the will.
  3. The extent of the testator’s properties and those jointly held
  4. If any previous Will had been made or not, and if the new Will is to revoke or add to the previous will.
  5. The names and addresses of the beneficiaries and the gifts made to them.
  6. The place of origin or ethnic nationality of the testator.
  7. The religion of the testator.
  8. Any relatives or dependants of the testator.
  9. Provisions for residuary gift clause beneficiaries.
  10. Any directives the testator may wish to give with respect to his funeral
  11. Custody of the will.
  12. Charging clause: payment for services rendered by executors
  13. Particulars of wife (wives) and children
  14. Particulars of witnesses (at least two-2): names and addresses

**CUSTODY OF WILLS**

These are the means of keeping Wills before the testator’s death. It can be kept in the following places:

- - 1. Banks 2. At the Probate Registry within the jurisdiction (this is the best place) 3. By the testator himself 4. With a trusted younger friend or relation 5. A copy left with his solicitor who prepared it 6. Executor appointed in the will

**Advantages of Keeping The Will With Probate Registry**

1. It complies with the requirements of the law. **S. 35 AEL**–The court should provide facilities for safe custody of Wills of living persons
2. It ensures safe custody **Order 48 Rule 16 Abuja HCCPR**
3. It aids in proof of the Will.
4. It facilitates the grant of probate.

**FORMAL PARTS OF A WILL**

Please take note you may be asked to draft some parts of a Will, especially **commencement**, **revocation clause**, **appointment, charging clause and execution clauses; (August 2014 Q 1h, 2016 Q 4d, 2019 Q 1c &i, January 2020 Q 4h, Dec 2020 Q 1g)**

1. **COMMENCEMENT**: Describes the document and the maker of the document as his act.

**This Is the Last Will and Testament of Me…… (Name)…………..of…… (Address)…….made this……Day of….20……..**

1. **REVOCATION CLAUSE**: (must be in all Wills even if client says he has never made a will before)

**“I Revoke All Former Testamentary Documents or Dispositions Made By Me”**

1. **APPOINTMENT CLAUSE**: This clause appoints the personal representatives, executors and trustees of the testator

**“I appoint**……………………**as the Executors of my Will”**

**CHAPTER TEN**

**PROBATE AND LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATION**

Probate is an official verification of a Will; it is an authority to the executors name in a Will to carry out the instructions contained in the Will.

**PROBATE IS GRANTED ONLY WHERE:**

- 1. **T**here is a valid Will and
  2. Executors were appointed in the Will.

**NOTE**: Where there is a Will but no executors were appointed, the Personal Representatives will apply for _Letters of Administration with Will Annexed_

**APPOINTMENT AND QUALIFICATION OF EXECUTORS**

Any adult individual or even a company can be appointed Executors. However, a minor and a person of unsound mind cannot be appointed executors.

**Factors to Consider in Appointing Executors (Personal Representatives)**

- - 1. Availability and willingness to act as Executors/personal Representative. 2. They are persons of younger ages. 3. Honesty and reliability. 4. People that can work together 5. Possibility of conflict of interest in the estate to be administered. 6. Knowledge and experience. 7. Proximity or closeness to the estate.

**Modes of Appointing Executors/Personal Representatives**

- - 1. Expressly by them been named in the Will. 2. Impliedly or by the tenor of the Will. 3. By operation of the Law, e.g. when the chain of executorship will not be allowed to be broken when all the executors granted probate are dead. The executor to the last Executor who died will be allowed to apply for Letters of Administration to continue with the execution of the Will left by the dead Executors**. S. 28 of the Administration of Estate Law of Lagos State.** 4. **Appointment by Nominee** i.e. authorisation of another to appoint the executors 5. **Appointment by the Courts**: The Court Will Appoint Executors in the Following Circumstances:

1. If person entitled to grant of probate is a minor or has a mental or physical infirmity, court can appoint another person.
2. Where there is only one executor and in the Will, there is a minority interest i.e. the deceased made provision for minor/child or old mother who has a life interest in a property. Where the sole executor is a trust corporation, then no need for court to appoint additional executor: **s. 24 AEL Lagos; (August 2014 Q 1g, 2018 Q 4ii)**
3. Where infant is the sole executor, court will appoint an administrator with will attached.
4. Where there is a Will but no executors were appointed therein.

**NUMBER OF EXECUTORS/PERSONAL ADMINISTRATORS**

**EXECUTORS**: The maximum of executors to be appointed is **4** and the minimum is **1** (one). Although it is not advisable, a sole or single executor can be appointed.

**ADMINISTRATORS**: maximum of **4** and a minimum of **2** can be appointed.

**NOTE**: A Trust Corporations can be appointed to be a **Sole Executor** of a Will; **see S. 9 & 24 AEL Lagos.**

- **NOTE THAT:** Where two executors were appointed and one dies before the testator without replacement, upon the testator’s death, the surviving sole executor may apply for and be granted probate.
- **NOTE ALSO THAT:** It is only the properties of the deceased covered or contained in the Will that can be administered with Probate. Any other property of the testator outside the Will can only be administered with **Letters of Administration** unless there is a residuary clause; see **(August 2018 Q 4iv).**

**DOUBLE PROBATE**

This arises when an **executor** applies for a **second grant** of Probate after a **first** **one** has been **granted to other Executors** duly appointed in a Will.

**The instances where double probate will be granted are:**

- - 1. The applicant is an infant executor who was denied a grant because of his age so upon reaching maturity he will be granted a double Probate. **(August 2013 Q 6Bi)** 2. Where a vacancy exists in the number of Executors, the reserved executors (if **more than 4** were appointed in a Will) will apply to fill it by a grant of double Probate. 3. An Executor was **abroad and arrived after the grant** of probate. He can apply for a double probate.

**TYPES OF PROBATE**

- - 1. **Common Form Probate**\- this is **non**\-**contentious** Probate as it is granted without any action in Court challenging the validity of the Will. 2. **Solemn Form Probate**\- this is a **contentious** Probate which is granted only after the action in Court challenging the validity of the Will have been determined.

**The Procedure to Obtain Non-Contentious Probate (April 2018 Q 3d, April 2019 Q 1Aiii & 6c,)**

1. Discovery of the Will.
2. The Solicitor will apply via a letter to the Probate Registrar informing him of the Testator’s death attaching:
3. CTC of the Will
4. Copy of the testator’s death certificate.
5. The letter must state the following:
6. Full name and alias of deceased person
7. Death of the testator accompanied with certificate
8. The place of death and date
9. The fact that the testator lived within the jurisdiction of the court
10. The fact that the testator made and deposited a Will at death
11. A date is fixed for the reading of the Will. On the fixed date, the Registrar then brings out the Will breaks the sealed wax on it and reads the Will in the presence of persons present and makes a record of the proceedings of the day. **_Ajibaiye v. Ajibaiye_**
12. The Probate Registrar will, give the following **FORMS** to the Executors to be completed and returned to the Registrar:
13. Application for grant of probate
14. Affidavit of attesting witnesses
15. Oath of Executors
16. Inventory Form
17. Justification of Sureties
18. Bank Certificate (to record the monies in Banks or shares in company owned by the testator before his death).
19. The Forms are duly filled and returned attaching passport photographs of the applicants and the witnesses to the Will.
20. Assessment of the Estate is conducted by the Registrar and Estate duty will be paid on the total asset-10 percent (10%) of the value of the estate
21. If satisfied, the Probate Registrar grants Probate to the Applicants with the copy of the Will attached

**How to Apply For Contentious Probate (Solemn Form Probate) (April 2019 Q 1Aii, August 2018 Q 4d)**

- - 1. The executors will **apply for grant of Probate** or if they **failed** to do so **a Notice of citation** will be given to the Executors to either **prove** the Will or renounce their executorship within **14** da**ys**. 2. If any person is objecting to the grant of Probate, he is to file a **Caveat as in Form 5** which is a notice to the Registrar not to grant Probate until the matter is resolved. The Caveat when filed **is to last for 3 months** once entered. 3. In response to the Caveat, the **applicants/executors** are to file a **Warning/Citation** stating their interest in the testator’s estate and requesting the caveator to state his interests **within 8 days of receipt of the warning.** 4. If the caveator failed to enter appearance by responding within 8 days to the Warning, he is deemed to have abandoned his claim and probate will be granted to the Applicants 5. An Affidavit is to be filed by the applicants when the Caveator defaults in appearance. 6. Conversely if the caveator responded **within the 8 days** and stated reasons for challenging the validity of the Will, issues have been joined and the applicants/caveator will go to trial proving/disproving the Will in question.
- - 1. At the conclusion of the action if it’s in favour of the Applicant’s, Probate in Solemn Form will be granted.

**Jurisdiction on the Use of Assent**

This depends on the area and the applicable Law as follows:

- - - 1. In Western Nigeria and in Lagos (PCL states), an assent must be used to vest title over a leasehold property on the beneficiary because the deceased real and personal property first vests in the personal representative before same can be later vested in the beneficiary**; _Renner v.

CGT = 500,000-100,000 = N400, 000.00 (vendor’s gain)

Allowable deductions = N100, 000. 00

400, 000.00-100, 000.00 = 300, 000.00

Capital gain tax = 10% of 300,000 = 10/100 x 300, 000.00 = N30, 000.00

**NOTE: Those Estate agents who are into the trade of selling land are exempted from paying Capital Gain Tax.**
